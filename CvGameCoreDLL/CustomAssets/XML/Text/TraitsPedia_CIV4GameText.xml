		<German>Dies ist eine Eigenschaft für Kriegstreiber. Viele der eigenen Einheiten (tatsächlich die besten Einheiten des Spiels: Nahkampf und Schießpulver) erhalten eine Extra-Beförderung und verbilligte Kasernen und Trockendocks sorgen für zusätzliche Beförderungen. Falls diese Eigenschaft nicht zum Führen von Kriegen verwendet wird, ist sie eigentlich komplett verschwendet.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_IRON_WORKING]Eisenverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CIVIL_SERVICE]Öffentliche Verwaltung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MACHINERY]Maschinen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUNPOWDER]Schießpulver[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CHEMISTRY]Chemie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RIFLING]Drall[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_STEEL]Stahl[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ASSEMBLY_LINE]Fließband[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heldenepos[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_RED_CROSS]Rotes Kreuz[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STATUE_OF_ZEUS]Zeus-Statue[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Trockendock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stallungen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_NATIONHOOD]Nationale Selbstständigkeit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Polizeistaat[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_STATE_PROPERTY]Staatseigentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie diese Eigenschaft eingesetzt werden soll? Im Krieg, natürlich. Immer noch nicht deutlich genug? Eine Horde Einheiten dazu benutzen, um andere Einheiten auszulöschen.[NEWLINE]Die eigenen Streitkräfte sollten am besten aus Einheiten zusammengesetzt sein, die von der Eigenschaft profitieren: Nahkampfeinheiten (Krieger, Axtkämpfer, Schwertkämpfer, Speerkämpfer, Streitkolbenträger, Pikeniere), Schießpulvereinheiten (Musketiere, Schützen, Grenadiere, Infanterie, SAM Infanterie, Marines, Mechanisierte Infanterie) und die Spezialeinheiten, die sie jeweils ersetzen.[NEWLINE]Die Technologie Stahl sollte vordringlich erforscht werden, um Trockendocks errichten zu können; ebenso verhält es sich mit Technologien, die Voraussetzung für die oben genannten Einheiten sind. Es sollte beachtet werden, dass einige der "aggressiven" Oberhäupter über eine Spezialeinheit verfügen, die von der Eigenschaft profitiert (Montezuma, Alexander, Tokugawa, Ragnar, Shaka), während bei anderen dies nicht der Fall ist (Dschinghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Stalin). Trotzdem können die letztgenannten natürlich Nutzen aus den verbilligten Kasernen ziehen. Außerdem sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass für einen Krieg mehr als nur Nahkampf- und Schießpulvereinheiten benötigt werden - Belagerungswaffen und Berittene Einheiten erhalten vielleicht nicht die Extra-Beförderung "Kampf I", sind aber trotzdem unverzichtbar.[NEWLINE]Das Weltwunder "Zeus-Statue" ist eine schöne Ergänzung für die eigene Zivilisation - hauptsächlich deswegen, damit niemand anderes es errichten kann. Kriegsunzufriedenheit ist schon schlimm genug; wenn sie sich aber verdoppelt, hat das desaströse Auswirkungen auf die eigenen Welteroberungspläne.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Eigenschaft "Aggressiv" selbst bietet keine wirtschaftlichen Vorteile und könnte den Anreiz zu einem enormen Anwachsen der Kosten liefern. Schließlich verursacht jede Einheit laufende Kosten und diese Kosten erhöhen sich, wenn die Einheit das eigene Hoheitsgebiet verlässt. Zusätzlich verursacht auch jede eroberte Stadt laufende Kosten. Übertriebene Eroberungen, speziell in der Frühphase einer Partie, können ebenso tödlich sein, wie übertriebene Expansion.[NEWLINE]Andererseits: Da "Aggressiv" meist auch bessere Einheiten bedeuten sollte, werden hoffentlich auch weniger von ihnen benötigt.</German>

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" wurde mit dem ersten Addon "Warlords" ins Spiel eingeführt (zusammen mit "Imperialistisch" und "Schützend") und ist sicherlich die nützlichste der drei neuen Eigenschaften. Sie ist eindeutig für Kriegstreiber gedacht, hauptsächlich wegen der gesenkten Erfahrungspunkte-Anforderungen für Beförderungen. Indem schon früh Kriege geführt werden, können sehr viele erfahrene, mit Massen von Beförderungen versehene Einheiten angesammelt werden, die im weiteren Spielverlauf noch weiter befördert werden können.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auch die zusätzliche Zufriedenheit dieser Eigenschaft und der zwei Gebäude unterstützt das Führen von Kriegen, da sie die Kriegsunzufriedenheit senkt. Außerdem unterstützt sie auch die eigene Wirtschaft; sei es nun eine Hüttenwirtschaft (CE), eine Spezialistenwirtschaft (SE) oder eine Mischung, eine höhere Bevölkerung auf Grund einer erhöhten Zufriedenheitsobergrenze bedeutet immer auch eine stärkere Wirtschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MYSTICISM]Mystik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_AGRICULTURE]Landwirtschaft[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ANIMAL_HUSBANDRY]Tierzucht[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RADIO]Funkwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASS_MEDIA]Massenmedien[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STONEHENGE]Stonehenge[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heldenepos[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_EIFFEL_TOWER]Eiffelturm[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MONUMENT]Monument[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stallungen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Trockendock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BROADCAST_TOWER]Funkturm[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Mit einem Oberhaupt mit der Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" sollten früh Kriege geführt werden, um Beförderungen zu erlangen und eine Armee erfahrener Einheiten aufstellen zu können. Falls die Option "Barbaren", oder sogar "Rasende Barbaren", aktiviert wurde, können mehr Beförderungen noch schneller angesammelt werden, so dass sehr wahrscheinlich nach der Ausrottung der Barbaren eine schlagkräftige Armee zur Verfügung steht, die dann bereit ist, sich den Nachbarzivilisationen zuzuwenden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Außerdem sollte von der erhöhten Zufriedenheitsobergrenze Gebrauch gemacht werden. Der Schwerpunkt sollte bereits früh in der Partie auf Wachstum gelegt werden: es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass jede Stadt über gute Nahrungsressourcen verfügt, die Forschung sollte geradewegs auf "Keramik" ausgerichtet werden, damit "Kornspeicher" errichtet werden können, und Bautrupps sollten aufgestellt werden, damit diese  für die Modernisierung der Stadtgeländefelder sorgen können, die dann von den zusätzlichen Bürgern bearbeitet werden können. Bautrupps und Siedler sollten wenn möglich durch das Abholzen von Wäldern beschleunigt werden, damit die Städte schneller wachsen können.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mystik" und "Massenmedien" stellen offensichtliche Forschungsziele dar, um die Gebäude verfügbar zu machen, die zur Erhöhung der Zufriedenheit beitragen (die durch die Eigenschaft leider nicht verbilligt werden; "Charismatisch" ist eine der wenigen Eigenschaften ohne verbilligtes Gebäude). Wahlweise kann auch das "Funkwesen" erforscht werden und der "Eiffelturm" errichtet werden, der einen kostenlosen "Funkturm" in jeder eigenen Stadt gewährt.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Stonehenge" ist ebenfalls ein attraktives Wunder, da es ein kostenloses "Monument" in jeder Stadt gewährt. Jedoch sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass diese Monumente magischerweise verschwinden, wenn "Kalender" erfoscht wurde ("Astronomie" in BtS). Im Gegensatz dazu veralten Funktürme und der Eiffelturm niemals. Außerdem verbleibt jedes selbst errichtete Monument in einer Stadt und generiert Kulturpunkte, die sich nach 1000 Jahren sogar verdoppeln.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie oben erwähnt, erhöht die Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" zwar den Effekt zweier Gebäude, verfügt aber selbst über kein verbilligtes Gebäude, was eine Beschränkung ist, die sie nur mit den Eigenschaften "Finanzorientiert" und "Imperialistisch" teilt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es kann etwas schwierig sein, das frühe Wachstum mit der Notwendigkeit zu vereinen, viele Bautrupps aufstellen zu müssen, die sicherstellen, dass die zusätzlichen Bürger modernisierte Geländefelder bearbeiten können. Zusätzlich muss jede Stadt mit mindestens einer Nahrungsressource versorgt sein und sollte außerdem in der Nähe von Wäldern gelegen sein, damit die Aufstellung von Bautrupps beschleunigt werden kann.</German>

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" ist vor allem in der frühen Phase einer Partie sehr nützlich, da sie die schnelle Erweiterung der eigenen Grenzen und damit die Inbesitznahme von neuen Gebieten und Ressourcen erlaubt. Der Patch 2.08 für das erste Addon "Warlords" fügte der Eigenschaft verbilligte Bibliotheken hinzu, die zu den besten Gebäuden des Spiels zählen, wodurch die Eigenschaft noch weiter aufgewertet wurde.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Schrift[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DRAMA]Drama[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CONSTRUCTION]Bauwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]keine[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Bibliothek[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_THEATRE]Theater[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSEUM]Kolosseum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Meinungsfreiheit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Der große Vorteil der Eigenschaft "Kreativ" besteht darin, dass mehr Freiheiten bei der Gründung einer Stadt und deren ersten Bauprojekten bestehen. Bei der Gründung einer Stadt muss nicht unbedingt darauf geachtet werden, dass sich eine wichtige Ressource im ersten Stadtfeldring befindet, damit sie sofort zugänglich ist; schon wenige Runden nach Gründung der Stadt steht sie zur Verfügung. Außerdem können Monumente, Stonehenge und die Verbreitung einer Religion außer Acht gelassen werden (nun, die letztere Aufgabe kann zumindest etwas entspannter angegangen werden).[PARAGRAPH:1]Zusätzlich kann die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" dabei helfen, schon früh in einer Partie das Tauziehen mit anderen Zivilisationen um Schlüsselgeländefelder, die mit wichtigen Ressourcen versehen sind, zu gewinnen. Ebenso kann die Eigenschaft, falls die Karte es erlaubt, dazu verwendet werden, um das Gebiet um einen Engpass abzuriegeln. "Kreativ" ist eher eine defensive Eigenschaft, nah verwandt mit der Eigenschaft "Schützend". Durch die frühe Erweiterung der eigenen Grenzen und die Belegung der Geländefelder mit der eigenen Kultur muss sich ein Gegner durch ein großes Gebiet quälen, bevor er angreifen kann. Außerdem wird es für andere Zivilisationen schwieriger, Geländefelder durch die Gründung von Städten oder deren Eroberung für sich zu gewinnen. Durch die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" erhöht sich der kulturelle Widerstand einer Stadt schneller, wodurch sie schwerer zu erobern ist.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Technologie "Schrift" schaltet die verbilligten Bibliotheken frei, so dass diese Technologie offensichtlich sogar noch wichtiger ist als zuvor. Die verbilligten Theater und Kolosseen können, abhängig von der eigenen Strategie und den Umständen der Partie, hilfreich sein oder auch nicht. Im mittleren bis späten Spielverlauf sollte ein Krieg geführt werden, um den größten Nutzen aus diesen Gebäuden ziehen zu können, indem sie zur Verringerung der Kriegsunzufriedenheit eingesetzt werden.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]"Kreativ" ist eine Eigenschaft, die in der frühen Phase einer Partie sehr nützlich ist und während des weiteren Spielverlaufs seinen Nutzen verliert. Die zusätzlichen +2[ICON_CULTURE] werden immer weniger entscheidend während die Partie fortschreitet und sich in jeder Stadt mehr Möglichkeiten zur Generierung von Kulturpunkten ergeben. Außerdem sind die verbilligten Gebäude schon früh in einer Partie verfügbar und daher gleich zu Anfang relativ günstig, so dass deren schnellere Produktionszeiten später in der Partie weniger von Vorteil sind. In der Mitte der meisten Partien spielt die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" fast keine Rolle mehr.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Expansive doesn't look that great at first glance. In fact, it first appears to belong in the category of "weak" traits, like Protective. After all, health is not a big problem; it's happiness that cramps your growth early in the game. And once you get used to those sickly green tendrils floating around your city, you realize that its effects aren't usually that bad. Health problems just slow growth a little.[PARAGRAPH:1]But hang on. Granaries--cheap for Expansive leaders--are one of the most useful buildings in the game.

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" sieht auf den ersten Blick nicht besonders interessant aus. Tatsächlich scheint sie, in die Kategorie der "schwachen" Eigenschaften zu gehören, wie beispielsweise "Schützend". Immerhin ist Gesundheit kein großes Problem, schließlich ist es die Zufriedenheit, die früh in einer Partie das eigene Wachstum hemmt. Und sobald diese kränklichen grünen Ranken, die um die eigenen Städte schweben, zur Normalität geworden sind, wird klar, dass ihre Auswirkungen in der Regel nicht so schlimm sind. Probleme mit der Gesundheit einer Stadt verlangsamen das Wachstum nur ein wenig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber abwarten. Kornspeicher, die für Oberhäupter mit der Eigenschaft "Expansiv" relativ günstig sind, sind eines der nützlichsten Gebäude im Spiel. Falls eine Getreide-Ressource verfügbar ist, erzeugen sie zusätzliche Gesundheit. Aber, was noch wichtiger ist, sie ermöglichen den wirksamen Einsatz der Staatsform "Sklaverei", da geopferte Bürger schneller "nachwachsen".[PARAGRAPH:1]Und mit dem Patch 2.08 für das erste Addon "Warlords" erhielt die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" eine dringend nötige Verstärkung durch leicht verbilligte Bautrupps. Es ist immer besser, mehr Bautrupps einsetzen zu können, besonders in der frühen Phase einer Partie.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Keramik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_COMPASS]Kompass[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HANGING_GARDEN]Hängende Gärten[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_NOTRE_DAME]Notre-Dame[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GRANARY]Kornspeicher[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HARBOR]Hafen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_SLAVERY]Sklaverei[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Das erste Forschungziel sollte "Keramik" sein. Außerdem sollten die verbilligten Kornspeicher errichtet werden (oder deren Produktion durch Zwangsarbeit beschleunigt werden). Die Produktion sollte immer durch Zwangsarbeit beschleunigt werden und zwar, wenn möglich, während der gesamten Partie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Daher ist es wichtig, sich darüber zu informieren, wie die Staatsform "Sklaverei" am wirksamsten eingesetzt wird, um den Produktionsüberschuss der Zwangsarbeit zu maximieren und somit sowohl das derzeitige Bauprojekt als auch das folgende schneller fertigstellen zu können. Dank dem Kornspeicher, wird die Bevölkerung schneller nachwachsen, wodurch der erneute Einsatz der Zwangsarbeit ermöglicht wird.[PARAGRAPH:1]Offensichtlich sollten auch mehr Bautrupps aufgestellt und eingesetzt werden, da sie ebenfalls verbilligt verfügbar sind. Eigene Geländefelder sollten so schnell wie möglich mit Modernisierungen ausgestattet und Ressourcen erschlossen werden. Dabei sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass die 25% höhere Produktionsgeschwindigkeit für Bautrupps von der Produktionsleistung abhängt und nicht von der Nahrungsproduktion, so dass einige Geländefelder mit produktionsfördernden Modernisierungen ausgestattet und diese auch während der Produktion eines Bautrupps bearbeitet werden sollten. Da Häfen ebenfalls verbilligt sind, sollte versucht werden, einige Küstenstädte zu erlangen, so dass der Vorteil dieses Gebäudes auch genutzt werden kann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Außerdem sollte nach Möglichkeiten Ausschau gehalten werden, um die zusätzlichen +2 Gesundheit wirksam einsetzen zu können. Beispielsweise kann schon früh eine Stadt mitten im Dschungel oder im Schwemmland platziert werden. Zusätzlich können gesundheitsvermindernde Gebäude wie Schmieden und Fabriken errichtet werden, ohne deren Einfluss auf die Gesundheit einer Stadt berücksichtigen zu müssen. Es können auch mehr Wälder abgeholzt werden, da deren Gesundheitsboni nicht benötigt (deswegen sind die Technologien "Bronzeverarbeitung" und "Mathematik" so interessant). Allerdings macht die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" die eigenen Städte nicht unbesiegbar, die Beschäftigung mit der Gesundheit der eigenen Städte wird nur weiter nach hinten verschoben als sonst üblich.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die "Hängende Gärten" sind ein interessantes Weltwunder für diese Eigenschaft. Auf den ersten Blick erscheint dies nicht so: Ein Gesundheitsbonus ist schon vorhanden. Warum sollte ein zusätzlicher benötigt werden? Weil mit dieser Eigenschaft eine Strategie verfolgt wird, die die Gesundheit der eigenen Städte bis zum Äußersten treibt, deshalb. Es sollten bevorzugt Wunder und Gebäude errichtet werden, die die Vorteile einer Eigenschaft noch weiter erhöhen (deshalb kann beispielsweise bei einem Oberhaupt mit der Eigenschaft "Philosophisch" versucht werden, das "Parthenon" zu errichten). Die "Hängende Gärten" erhöhen außerdem die Bevölkerungszahl, die wiederum für Zwangsarbeit eingesetzt werden können. Und gewähren noch Große Persönlichkeit-Punkte für einen Großen Ingenieur! Das ist großartig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Weltwunder "Notre-Dame" kann ebenfalls nützlich sein. Bei wiederholtem Einsatz der Zwangsarbeit, kann der Zufriedenheitsbonus dieser großen Kathedrale tatsächlich sehr angenehm sein.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie bei vielen andere Eigenschaften, beispielsweise "Kreativ", lassen die Vorteile der Eigenschaft "Expansiv" im Verlauf einer Partie nach. Andere Methoden, um die Gesundheit zu erhöhen, werden verfügbar, die verbilligten Gebäude sind nur in der frühen Phase einer Partie von Vorteil und sobald das eigene Schienennetz gegen Ende einer Partie vollendet ist, werden die Massen von billigen Bautrupps nutzlos. Außerdem könnte der Wunsch aufkommen, von der "Sklaverei" zu einer anderen Staatsform zu wechseln, wodurch einer der Hauptvorteile der verbilligten Kornspeicher verloren ginge.[PARAGRAPH:1]Und wie viele andere Eigenschaften gewährt "Expansiv" keine direkten wirtschaftlichen Vorteile.</German>

		<English>[TAB]This is quite probably the strongest of the traits, at least at levels below Emperor, so much so that many players consider Financial to be a "crutch" and avoid leaders with this trait because they feel it offers an unfair advantage. The game developers apparently agreed, hence in one of the early patches they removed the double production speed of banks to lessen its power. Even so, Financial remains a truly awesome trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first, it seems so subtle: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] on some tiles? So what?[PARAGRAPH:1]The answer, of course, is this: It's the economy, stupid. Say what you want about military, research, religion, and other game elements; ultimately, your civilization requires a robust economy in order to support everything else you do. Military units incur maintenance costs, more so if they're outside of your territory. Cities likewise have maintenance costs, hampering your rate of expansion and requiring you to ensure each city can somehow pay for itself. And to keep up in technology you have to be able to set aside funds to support research. The Financial trait makes all of these tasks a little easier--if handled well, a lot easier.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Pottery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CURRENCY]Currency[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUILDS]Guilds[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BANKING]Banking[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_LIBERALISM]Liberalism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PRINTING_PRESS]Printing Press[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DEMOCRACY]Democracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CORPORATION]Corporation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSUS]The Colossus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WALL_STREET]Wall Street[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MARKET]Market[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GROCER]Grocer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BANK]Bank[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]University[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_OBSERVATORY]Observatory[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LABORATORY]Laboratory[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_EMANCIPATION]Emancipation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The main way to leverage the financial trait is very straightforward: cottage spam. Yes, the tried-and-true Cottage Economy, or CE. Have your [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Workers[\LINK] lay down as many [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]cottages[\LINK] as your population can work while still working other worthwhile tiles as well. I'm especially fond of placing cottages on riverside grassland tiles, as the Financial benefit kicks in as soon as the cottage is built, and the 2 food feeds the citizen working the tile (floodplains, with 3 food, are even better for cottages, supporting city growth along with the economy). Just remember you may have to irrigate some of those tiles instead, by placing farms on them, in order to feed and grow your population and/or to chain irrigate another tile. Make sure you have citizens working the cottages steadily, however, as it's the only way to make them grow and increase their revenue.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, be on the lookout for resources that provide additional commerce. Gems, gold, and silver are obvious targets, but spices, silk, and wine are good as well; all will earn you the +1[ICON_COMMERCE] benefit in addition to the additional commerce of the resource. You want to claim these resources, ensure they're in a city's fat cross, and are improved and then worked by a citizen. Most of the commerce-rich resources also increase happiness, which means you can grow your other cities larger and, in turn, work more cottages and other commerce-rich tiles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you'll have all that extra commerce rolling in, prioritize buildings that do something with it, and the technologies that enable them. Libraries, monasteries, universities, observatories, and laboratories all multiply the amount of research you convert from commerce via the science slider, while markets, grocers, and banks multiply whatever gold is left over. In addition, Printing Press will increase the yield from your cottage investment, as will the Free Speech civic. Emancipation will make any immature cottages grow faster.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]First off, Financial provides no direct benefit to a tile that isn't providing at least 2 commerce. This can make you reluctant to work tiles without the benefit, even though you will need to. This means a production city, which mostly works hammer-rich rather than commerce-rich tiles, gains no direct benefit from the trait. You will, however, need at least one production city, preferably more, so don't overlook them in favour of commerce cities. The same goes for tile improvements. Yes, you can place a cottage on a grassland hill. But should you? A mine would provide much-needed hammers, something commerce cities often chronically lack.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest problem with Financial, however, is the vulnerability of your economy, especially as time goes on. It takes a lot of turns to make a cottage grow into a town, but that investment can be quickly undone by a couple of pillaging enemy units. And the not-inconsiderable amount of gold to be gained from pillaging cottages is very tempting to the AI. You will need to garrison your best, oldest commerce cities with anti-pillaging units if you go to war. Also try to have your best commerce cities inland at the heart of your empire, rather than on the more vulnerable borders or coastline.</English>

The Financial trait makes all of these tasks a little easier--if handled well, a lot easier.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Pottery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CURRENCY]Currency[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUILDS]Guilds[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BANKING]Banking[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_LIBERALISM]Liberalism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PRINTING_PRESS]Printing Press[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DEMOCRACY]Democracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CORPORATION]Corporation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSUS]The Colossus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WALL_STREET]Wall Street[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MARKET]Market[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GROCER]Grocer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BANK]Bank[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]University[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_OBSERVATORY]Observatory[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LABORATORY]Laboratory[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_EMANCIPATION]Emancipation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The main way to leverage the financial trait is very straightforward: cottage spam. Yes, the tried-and-true Cottage Economy, or CE. Have your [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Workers[\LINK] lay down as many [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]cottages[\LINK] as your population can work while still working other worthwhile tiles as well. I'm especially fond of placing cottages on riverside grassland tiles, as the Financial benefit kicks in as soon as the cottage is built, and the 2 food feeds the citizen working the tile (floodplains, with 3 food, are even better for cottages, supporting city growth along with the economy). Just remember you may have to irrigate some of those tiles instead, by placing farms on them, in order to feed and grow your population and/or to chain irrigate another tile. Make sure you have citizens working the cottages steadily, however, as it's the only way to make them grow and increase their revenue.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, be on the lookout for resources that provide additional commerce. Gems, gold, and silver are obvious targets, but spices, silk, and wine are good as well; all will earn you the +1[ICON_COMMERCE] benefit in addition to the additional commerce of the resource. You want to claim these resources, ensure they're in a city's fat cross, and are improved and then worked by a citizen. Most of the commerce-rich resources also increase happiness, which means you can grow your other cities larger and, in turn, work more cottages and other commerce-rich tiles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you'll have all that extra commerce rolling in, prioritize buildings that do something with it, and the technologies that enable them. Libraries, monasteries, universities, observatories, and laboratories all multiply the amount of research you convert from commerce via the science slider, while markets, grocers, and banks multiply whatever gold is left over. In addition, Printing Press will increase the yield from your cottage investment, as will the Free Speech civic. Emancipation will make any immature cottages grow faster.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]First off, Financial provides no direct benefit to a tile that isn't providing at least 2 commerce. This can make you reluctant to work tiles without the benefit, even though you will need to. This means a production city, which mostly works hammer-rich rather than commerce-rich tiles, gains no direct benefit from the trait. You will, however, need at least one production city, preferably more, so don't overlook them in favour of commerce cities. The same goes for tile improvements. Yes, you can place a cottage on a grassland hill. But should you? A mine would provide much-needed hammers, something commerce cities often chronically lack.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest problem with Financial, however, is the vulnerability of your economy, especially as time goes on. It takes a lot of turns to make a cottage grow into a town, but that investment can be quickly undone by a couple of pillaging enemy units. And the not-inconsiderable amount of gold to be gained from pillaging cottages is very tempting to the AI. You will need to garrison your best, oldest commerce cities with anti-pillaging units if you go to war. Also try to have your best commerce cities inland at the heart of your empire, rather than on the more vulnerable borders or coastline.</French>
		<German>Dies ist vermutlich die mächtigste Eigenschaft, zumindest in den Schwierigkeitsgraden unterhalb von "Kaiser".  Das geht so weit, dass viele Spieler "Finanzorientiert" als "Krücke" ansehen und Oberhäupter mit dieser Eigenschaft meiden, da sie ihrer Meinung nach einen unfairen Vorteil darstellt. Die Spieleentwickler sahen das offensichtlich genauso. Denn sie haben in einem frühen Patch die doppelte Produktionsgeschwindigkeiten von Banken entfernt und die Eigenschaft damit geschwächt. Trotzdem bleibt "Finanzorientiert" eine fantastische Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auf den ersten Blick sieht es so bescheiden aus: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] auf einigen Geländefeldern? Na und?[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Antwort ist natürlich folgende: Es geht um die Wirtschaft. Über Militär, Forschung, Religion und andere Spielelemente kann viel gesagt werden; letztlich benötigt eine Zivilisation eine stabile Wirtschaft, um alles andere zu ermöglichen. Militäreinheiten verursachen Unterhaltskosten, noch höhere außerhalb des eigenen Territoriums. Städte verursachen ebenfalls Unterhaltskosten, die das Wachstum bremsen und es erforderlich machen, dass sich jede Stadt irgendwie selbst tragen kann. Und um in der Technologie mithalten zu können, müssen Mittel beiseite gelegt werden, um die Forschung zu unterstützen. Die Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" macht all diese Aufgaben etwas einfacher - bei richtiger Anwendung sogar viel einfacher.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Keramik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CURRENCY]Währung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUILDS]Gilden[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BANKING]Bankwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_LIBERALISM]Liberalismus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PRINTING_PRESS]Druckerpresse[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DEMOCRACY]Demokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CORPORATION]Kapitalgesellschaft[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSUS]Koloss[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WALL_STREET]Wall Street[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MARKET]Markt[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GROCER]Krämer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BANK]Bank[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Bibliothek[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]Universität[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_OBSERVATORY]Observatorium[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LABORATORY]Labor[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Meinungsfreiheit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_EMANCIPATION]Emanzipation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Es ist recht unkompliziert die Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" zum eigenen Vorteil zu nutzen und zwar mit der Hüttenschwemme (engl.: cottage spam). Ja, die altbewährte Hüttenwirtschaft (engl.: cottage economy, oder kurz CE). Dazu müssen [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Bautrupps[\LINK] so viele [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]Hütten[\LINK] errichten, wie die eigene Bevölkerung bewirtschaften kann, während diese gleichzeitig auch andere wertvolle Geländefelder bewirtschaftet. Am wirkungsvollsten werden Hütten auf Grasland neben Flüssen platziert, da der Vorteil von "Finanzorientiert" einsetzt, sobald die Hütte erichtet ist, während die 2 Nahrungseinheiten den Bürger ernährt, der das Feld bewirtschaftet (Schwemmland mit 3 Nahrungseinheiten ist noch besser für Hütten geeignet, da es neben der Wirtschaft auch das Stadtwachstum unterstützt). Allerdings sollte bedacht werden, dass stattdessen einige Geländefelder durch den Bau von Bauernhöfen bewässert werden müssen, um die eigene Bevölkerung zu ernähren und zu vermehren und/oder um die Bewässerung von entfernten Geländefelder zu ermöglichen. Es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass die Hütten stets bewirtschaftet werden, da sie sich nur dann weiterentwickeln und die Erträge erhöhen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Außerdem sollte auch auf die Erschließung von Ressourcen geachtet werden, die zusätzliche Wirtschaftserträge generieren. Edelsteine, Gold und Silber sind offensichtliche Ziele, aber Gewürze, Seide und Wein sind ebenso nützlich; sie alle erbringen +1[ICON_COMMERCE] zusätzlich zum Handelsertrag der Ressource. Es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass diese Ressourcen sich in einem Stadtkreuz befinden, von einem Bautrupp erschlossen und dann bewirtschaftet werden. Die meisten Ressourcen mit erhöhten Wirtschaftserträgen steigern auch die Zufriedenheit der Bürger, wodurch die eigenen Städte stärker wachsen können, die so wiederum mehr Hütten und weitere Geländefelder mit Wirtschaftsboni bewirtschaften können.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit all diesen zusätzlichen Wirtschaftserträgen sollte vor allem der Bau von Gebäuden, die mit diesen etwas anfangen können, sowie die Technologien gefördert werden, die diese Gebäude ermöglichen. Bibliotheken, Klöster, Universitäten, Observatorien und Labore vervielfältigen die Menge der Forschungserträge, die aus den Wirtschaftserträgen über die Einstellung des Forschungsanteils konvertiert werden, während Märkte, Krämer und Banken das verbliebene Gold vermehren. Zusätzlich erhöht die Erforschung der Technologie "Druckerpresse" und die Staatsform "Meinungsfreiheit" die Erträge der Hütten. Mit Hilfe der Staatsform "Emanzipation" entwickeln sich die Hütten schneller.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Zunächst bewirkt "Finanzorintiert" bei Geländefeldern mit weniger als 2 Wirtschaftserträgen keine direkte Verbesserung. Dadurch ergibt sich automatisch eine gewisser Widerwillen, solche Geländefelder zu bearbeiten, auch wenn es nötig ist. Das bedeutet, dass eine Produktionsstadt, die hauptsächlich Produktionserträge statt Wirtschaftserträge generiert, keinen direkten Nutzen von dieser Eigenschaft bezieht. Trotzdem wird mindestens eine Produktionsstadt benötigt, aber besser mehrere. Deshalb sollten diese nicht zugunsten von Finanzstädten vernachlässigt werden. Gleiches gilt für die Verbesserung von Geländefeldern. Ja, man kann eine Hütte auf einem Hügel mit Grasland errichten, aber sollte man auch? Eine Mine würde die dringend benötigten Produktionserträge generieren, an denen es Finanzstädten typischerweise mangelt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das größte Problem der Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" ist jedoch die Verletzlichkeit der Wirtschaft, insbesondere später in einer Partie. Eine Hütte benötigt viele Runden, damit sie zu einer Gemeinde wächst, aber diese Investition kann durch ein paar plündernde feindliche Einheiten schnell zunichte gemacht werden. Und der nicht zu verachtende Goldertrag beim Plündern von Hütten ist für Gegenspieler sehr verlockend. Daher müssen die besten, ältesten Finanzstädte mit Einheiten gesichert werden, die Plünderungen verhindern können, wenn ein Krieg beginnt. Zudem sollte darauf geachtet werden, die besten Finanzstädte im Herzen des eigenen Reiches anzusiedeln und nicht an den gefährdeten Grenzen oder Küsten.</German>

		<English>[TAB]After several off-line games as Julius Caesar, my opinion of this trait has improved. I originally included it in the "Weak" category, but now feel it belongs in "Medium"--if it's used properly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Imperialistic supports aggressive expansion in two ways. First of all, Settlers are cheaper to build, allowing you to perform a faster land-grab early in the game. Second, to take advantage of the increased Great General emergence, you're encouraged to expand through aggression.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronze Working[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Masonry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematics[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FASCISM]Fascism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]All military technologies[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_WALL]The Great Wall[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MT_RUSHMORE]Mount Rushmore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Police State[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Obviously, pursue a REX (Rapid EXpansion) strategy in the early game, and follow this up with an aggressive, warmonger's expansion policy once your core cities are established. This especially suits Catherine the Great of Russia, since her Creative trait has definite synergy with an early game land-grabbing strategy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keep in mind that the increased Settler production comes from hammers, not food. This means you'll want to focus as much on mines as farms and pastures when improving tiles in the early game. Chopping and whipping contribute hammers, so those get multiplied by the trait as well--hence the attraction of Bronze Working and Mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:1]You can enhance the increased GG emergence further by building the Great Wall. In addition to keeping barbs away, that wonder also provides +100% Great General emergence from battles that take place within your cultural borders, resulting in a +200% GG boost with the trait when defending within your own territory. Masonry, therefore, and a source of stone are likely to be priorities when playing as a leader with this trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The chief way to take advantage of the Imperialistic trait once the original period of REX is over is simple: war. War early and war often. It's the only way to generate Great Generals (and remember that battling barbs earns you XPs, but not points towards a Great General.) Great Generals are actually one of the most useful Great People in the game, even if they lack some of the uses of other GPs (such as lightbulbing technologies or starting a Golden Age). You can attach them to units to uber-promote them, put them in cities to provide additional XPs or boost unit production with a military academy. Just remember to prioritize Code of Laws and courthouses to keep your ever-expanding empire economically viable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many players favour combining the first Great General with a unit and giving it the Medic I, II, and III promotions. This medic unit will heal your stacks faster, allowing them to return to the fray much sooner. You can also use a GG to give a unit the Leadership promotion, which creates synergy with the Imperialistic trait because the promotion results in double XPs for that unit from every battle it survives, and those double XPs are doubled again in their count towards your next Great General. You can also combine the GG with a Caravel to give it Flanking I, Navigtion I, and Navigation II in order to practically guarantee winning the circumnavigation bonus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you're going after several Great Generals (and likely basing much of your strategy on their benefits), you'll want to snag the free one that you get from researching Fascism first. With all the warmongering you'll be doing, you're going to want to build Mount Rushmore and run Police State to alleviate some of the War Weariness anyway.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Well, for starters, there's no cheap building and no economic advantage. It seems logical that Imperialistic should have cheap courthouses, but Organized has those, and shifting them away would seriously weaken that trait. Perhaps jails would have been a good cheap building for Imperialistic. If Civ IV had useful forts, faster build times of those would have been logical for this trait as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead of a cheap building, however, there's a cheap unit. But Imperialistic's boost to Settler builds comes from hammers, not food. This means you need to work at cross-purposes in the early game, building mines to ensure your Settler builds take advantage of the trait. If food also boosted the Setter's build time, this would be a much stronger trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest weakness of the trait, however, is that it locks you into a specific strategy. You don't have to play as a warmonger with the Aggressive trait; you could leverage it to build a strong army and military infrastructure (the cheap barracks and drydocks count towards your power rating, after all) so you're left alone to build. With Imperialistic, however, you have to warmonger. There's no other way to earn those Great Generals except by fighting other civs. Don't play with this trait unless you're in the mood to knock heads, or you're wasting it.</English>

Second, to take advantage of the increased Great General emergence, you're encouraged to expand through aggression.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronze Working[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Masonry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematics[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FASCISM]Fascism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]All military technologies[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_WALL]The Great Wall[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MT_RUSHMORE]Mount Rushmore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Police State[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Obviously, pursue a REX (Rapid EXpansion) strategy in the early game, and follow this up with an aggressive, warmonger's expansion policy once your core cities are established. This especially suits Catherine the Great of Russia, since her Creative trait has definite synergy with an early game land-grabbing strategy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keep in mind that the increased Settler production comes from hammers, not food. This means you'll want to focus as much on mines as farms and pastures when improving tiles in the early game. Chopping and whipping contribute hammers, so those get multiplied by the trait as well--hence the attraction of Bronze Working and Mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:1]You can enhance the increased GG emergence further by building the Great Wall. In addition to keeping barbs away, that wonder also provides +100% Great General emergence from battles that take place within your cultural borders, resulting in a +200% GG boost with the trait when defending within your own territory. Masonry, therefore, and a source of stone are likely to be priorities when playing as a leader with this trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The chief way to take advantage of the Imperialistic trait once the original period of REX is over is simple: war. War early and war often. It's the only way to generate Great Generals (and remember that battling barbs earns you XPs, but not points towards a Great General.) Great Generals are actually one of the most useful Great People in the game, even if they lack some of the uses of other GPs (such as lightbulbing technologies or starting a Golden Age). You can attach them to units to uber-promote them, put them in cities to provide additional XPs or boost unit production with a military academy. Just remember to prioritize Code of Laws and courthouses to keep your ever-expanding empire economically viable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many players favour combining the first Great General with a unit and giving it the Medic I, II, and III promotions. This medic unit will heal your stacks faster, allowing them to return to the fray much sooner. You can also use a GG to give a unit the Leadership promotion, which creates synergy with the Imperialistic trait because the promotion results in double XPs for that unit from every battle it survives, and those double XPs are doubled again in their count towards your next Great General. You can also combine the GG with a Caravel to give it Flanking I, Navigtion I, and Navigation II in order to practically guarantee winning the circumnavigation bonus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you're going after several Great Generals (and likely basing much of your strategy on their benefits), you'll want to snag the free one that you get from researching Fascism first. With all the warmongering you'll be doing, you're going to want to build Mount Rushmore and run Police State to alleviate some of the War Weariness anyway.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Well, for starters, there's no cheap building and no economic advantage. It seems logical that Imperialistic should have cheap courthouses, but Organized has those, and shifting them away would seriously weaken that trait. Perhaps jails would have been a good cheap building for Imperialistic. If Civ IV had useful forts, faster build times of those would have been logical for this trait as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead of a cheap building, however, there's a cheap unit. But Imperialistic's boost to Settler builds comes from hammers, not food. This means you need to work at cross-purposes in the early game, building mines to ensure your Settler builds take advantage of the trait. If food also boosted the Setter's build time, this would be a much stronger trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest weakness of the trait, however, is that it locks you into a specific strategy. You don't have to play as a warmonger with the Aggressive trait; you could leverage it to build a strong army and military infrastructure (the cheap barracks and drydocks count towards your power rating, after all) so you're left alone to build. With Imperialistic, however, you have to warmonger. There's no other way to earn those Great Generals except by fighting other civs. Don't play with this trait unless you're in the mood to knock heads, or you're wasting it.</French>
		<German>Nach einigen Einzelspielerpartien mit Julius Cäsar wandelt sich die Meinung vieler Spieler zu dieser Eigenschaft normalerweise. Ursprünglich würde man sie als schwach einstufen, doch spätestens danach sollte sie eher unter den mittelstarken Eigenschaften eingeordnet werden - falls sie richtig eingesetzt wird.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Imperialistisch" unterstützt eine agressive Expansion in zweifacher Weise. Erstens sind Siedler kostengünstiger zu produzieren, wodurch schon früh in einer Partie schnell sehr viel Land besetzt werden kann. Zweitens wird man dazu ermutigt, durch Kriege zu expandieren, um von der größeren Wahrscheinlichkeit des Erscheinens eines Großen Generals zu profitieren.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Steinmetzkunst[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Gesetzgebung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FASCISM]Faschismus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Alle militärischen Technologien[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_WALL]Große Mauer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MT_RUSHMORE]Mount Rushmore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Gebäude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nützliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Polizeistaat[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzmöglichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Offensichtlich sollte in der Frühphase einer Partie eine Strategie der schnellen Expansion (engl. REX = Rapid EXpansion) verfolgt werden, die von einer aggressiven und kriegerischen Expansionspolitik gefolgt wird, sobald die Kernstädte entsprechend ausgebaut worden sind. Das passt am besten zu Katharina der Großen (Russland), da ihre Eigenschaft "Kreativ" eindeutig Synergien mit einer Strategie der frühen Landnahme fördert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dabei sollte bedacht werden, dass die beschleunigte Siedlerproduktion durch Hämmer erfolgt, nicht durch Nahrung. Das bedeutet, dass bereits in der Frühphase einer Partie die Errichtung von Minen genauso wichtig ist, wie jene von Feldern und Weiden. Das Roden von Wäldern und Opfern von Bevölkerung produzieren ebenfalls Hämmer, die durch die Eigenschaft multipliziert werden - deshalb sind Bronzeverarbeitung und Mathematik so reizvolle Forschungsziele.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durch den Bau des Wunders "Große Mauer" kann das Erscheinen von Großen Generälen noch weiter beschleunigt werden. Dieses Wunder hält nicht nur Barbaren ab, sondern erhöht auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Erscheinens von Großen Generälen bei Kämpfen innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen um 100%, was mit dieser Eigenschaft zu einer Steigerung der Wahrscheinlichkeit um 200% führt, wenn Kämpfe innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen gewonnen werden. Die Erforschung der Technologie "Steinmetzkunst" und die Erlangung von Steinressourcen gehören somit auch zu den ersten Prioritäten dieser Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der beste Weg, die Eigenschaft "Imperialistisch" nach der Phase der frühen Expansion zu nutzen, ist einfach: Krieg. Man sollte oft und frühzeitig Krieg führen. Nur so können Große Generäle erscheinen (Kämpfe gegen Barbaren erbringen zwar Erfahrungspunkte, tragen aber nicht zum Erscheinen eines Großen Generals bei). Große Generäle gehören tatsächlich zu den nützlichsten Großen Persönlichkeiten im Spiel, auch wenn ihnen einige der Eigenschaften der anderen GPs fehlen (wie Beschleunigung der Forschung oder das Einläuten eines Goldenen Zeitalters). Sie können anderen Einheiten zugewiesen werden, um diese mehrfach zu befördern, in Städten die Erfahrungspunkte neuer Einheiten erhöhen oder die Einheitenproduktion durch eine Militärakademie beschleunigen. Dabei sollte bedacht werden, das die Technolgie "Gesetzgebung" bevorzugt erforscht und die Errichtung von Gerichtsgebäuden priorisiert werden sollte, um das stets wachsende Imperium ökonomisch am Leben zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele Spieler kombinieren bevorzugt den ersten Großen General mit einer Einheit und geben ihr die Beförderungen "Sanitäter I, II und III". Diese Sanitätseinheit lässt Armeen schneller heilen, so dass diese viel schneller in neue Schlachten ziehen können. Ein Großer General kann auch die Beförderung "Führerschaft" erteilen, die sich mit der Eigenschaft "Imperialistisch" bestens ergänzt, da diese Beförderung einer Einheit doppelte EPs nach jedem siegreichen Kampf gewährt, die dann natürlich auch doppelt zum Erscheinen des nächsten Großen Generals beitragen. Man kann den GG auch mit einer Karavelle kombinieren, um ihr die Beförderungen "Flanke I" und "Navigation I und II" zu verleihen, und so den Gewinn des Weltumseglungsbonus praktisch zu garantieren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem das Ziel eine möglichst große Anzahl Große Generäle ist (und die Strategie zum Großteil auf ihren Nutzen ausgerichtet ist), sollte man sich auch zuerst den kostenlosen GG durch die Ersterforschung der Technologie "Faschismus" sichern. Bei all der Kriegstreiberei sollte das Wunder "Mount Rushmore" errichtet und die Staatsform "Polizeistaat" angenommen werden, um einen Teil der Kriegsmüdigkeit zu mildern.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Nun, zunächst einmal gibt es kein vergünstigtes Gebäude und keinen wirtschaftlichen Vorteil. Es erscheint logisch, dass "Imperialistisch" über günstige Gerichtsgebäude verfügen sollte, doch diesen Bonus hat bereits die Eigenschaft "Organisiert", die ohne ihn zu sehr geschwächt würde. Vielleicht wären Gefängnisse geeignete vergünstigte Gebäude für "Imperialistisch". Wenn es in Civilization IV vernünftige Forts gäbe, wären für diese schnellere Bauzeiten in Kombination mit dieser Eigenschaft sinnvoll gewesen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Statt günstigen Gebäuden gibt es aber eine günstige Einheit. Aber die Produktionsbeschleunigung von Siedlern erwächst aus Hämmern, nicht aus Nahrung. Deshalb muss schon früh mit widersprüchlichen Vorgaben gearbeitet werden, da Minen errichtet werden müssen, damit die Siedlerproduktion die Vorteile dieser Eigenschaft nutzen kann. Wenn Nahrung die Siedlerproduktion ebenfalls beschleunigen würde, wäre dies eine viel stärkere Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die größte Schwäche dieser Eigenschaft liegt jedoch darin, dass sie den Spieler auf eine spezielle Strategie festlegt. Mit der Eigenschaft "Agressiv" muss man nicht den Kriegstreiber spielen. Man kann sie auch einsetzen, um eine starke Armee und militärische Infrastruktur aufzubauen (schließlich bestimmen auch die billigen Kasernen und Trockendocks den Rang), und wird dann beim Ausbau der Imperiums in Ruhe gelassen. Mit "Imperialistisch" gibt es aber keine Alternative zum Krieg. Es gibt keinen anderen Weg, das Erscheinen von Großen Generälen zu fördern, als durch den Kampf mit anderen Zivilisationen. Deshalb sollte diese Eigenschaft nur gewählt werden, wenn man in der Stimmung ist, ein paar Köpfe rollen zu lassen, sonst ist sie verschwendet.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Just as the Financial trait lends itself to the Commerce Economy, the Philosophical trait lends itself to the Specialist Economy (SE). The SE, of course, has many adherents, and the debate over which economy is best rages on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suffice it to say that the SE is strongest in the hands of a Philosophical leader, since running all those specialists will result in many more Great People. You don't have to run a SE with a Philosophical leader, just as you can run a CE without the Financial trait, but the SE and the Philosophical trait are both at their strongest when combined.[PARAGRAPH:1]Great People have many uses, of course. In the Specialist Economy, they are principally used for "lightbulbing", that is, using the Great Person to discover a technology, usually research-free.

This allows you to grow those cities even larger so you can work more farms and run more specialists.

Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well.

The fact that I consider this one of the weakest traits should not come as a surprise, since that's an opinion shared by most players--though I grant that Protective does have its fans.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ARCHERY]Archery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Masonry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POLYTHEISM]Polytheism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_SAILING]Sailing[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FEUDALISM]Feudalism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MACHINERY]Machinery[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ENGINEERING]Engineering[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUNPOWDER]Gunpowder[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CHEMISTRY]Chemistry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RIFLING]Rifling[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ASSEMBLY_LINE]Assembly Line[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TEMPLE_OF_ARTEMIS]The Temple of Artemis[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_LIGHTHOUSE]The Great Lighthouse[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_CHICHEN_ITZA]Chichen Itza[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WALLS]Walls[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_CASTLE]Castle[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]While Protective is weak, it isn't without its uses. When you capture a city, your freely-promoted units are better equipped to defend your new possession, which is highly likely to come under a counter-attack. In fact, your gunpowder units can potentially perform double-duty as both attackers and defenders. (Most archery units, however, are weak attackers and are best used on defense only.)[PARAGRAPH:1]If you have a source of stone, the walls and castles are even cheaper, making them less of a burden to build. Combined with wonders like the Temple of Artemis and the Great Lighthouse, you could make Protective's cheap castles part of a trade route economy, which can be very helpful in the mid-game period. You can also use the cheap castles to supplement espionage in BtS. In fact, some players have begun playing an EP, or "Espionage Economy", where the science slider is turned down to 0% after Alphabet and most remaining technologies are acquired through tech-stealing.[PARAGRAPH:1]The civilization that probably benefits the most from the trait is China, because its UU is one of the best Archery units in the game--the Cho-Ko-Nu, which can and should be used as an attacking unit. Drill I just enhances its power, giving it an additional first strike chance beyond its 2 free first strikes.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The problem with the Protective trait is that it's largely defensive in nature. The free City Garrison promotion is only useful when units are under attack while in a city. Walls and castles--which are pretty cheap to begin with, making their double production speed less appealing--are likewise only useful when you're under attack. Only the free Drill I promotion is an attacking promotion, but how often do you attack with archery units? Unless they're Cho-Ko- Nus, of course. (Though it can be beneficial to your more aggressive gunpowder units.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The problem with playing defensively in Civilization IV is that the AI is so fond of pillaging. If your units cower behind city walls, the AI will gleefully send your economy spiraling down into ruin by pillaging every tile improvement in sight. Your units have to venture out of your cities to defend your territory, which makes walls and castles next to useless--ditto with the City Garrison promotion.[PARAGRAPH:1]In many ways, the Protective trait seems to have been added more to benefit the AI than the human player. The AI prefers to play defensively for the most part, so Protective suits its programming. Any human player will tell you that going up against Protective Longbowmen, fortified in a city on a hill with a castle and walls, can be intimidating--though certainly not insurmountable. Just bring more Trebuchets to the party.</English>

		<English>[TAB]As with Financial, Spiritual's great strength comes from its positive impact on your economy. Anarchy means that for one turn or more, your cities do not grow or build anything, your culture does not increase, GPP are not accumulated, cottages do not grow, and so on. Spiritual means you avoid those periods of economic stasis; this should result in your being able to research at least one or two additional technologies, build several more units and buildings, produce more Great People, and so on, compared to a non-Spiritual civ.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike several other traits, Spiritual's effects do not decrease later in the game. On the contrary, as more civics and religions become available, you may want and need to change civics more often, and Spiritual lets you do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, this trait has slipped, in my opinion, from being one of the strongest to being a medium-strength trait. This is mainly because of the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Frankly, many disputed my inclusion of it in the "Strong" category to begin with. But Beyond the Sword has reduced its strength by making its effects easier to obtain. You now only need to use one Great Person, not two, in order to bring about your first Golden Age; and you can now change civics anarchy-free during a Golden Age. This is just one of many was that Golden Ages have been improved and made more attractive in Beyond the Sword.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, in the late game, when you have access to all the civics and Spiritual is normally at its strongest, you can now achieve the same effects by building the new Cristo Redentor wonder, which not only gives you Spiritual's ability to change civics anarchy-free; you can also change civics without having to wait for a single turn change, let alone the usual five! (Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)[PARAGRAPH:1]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that enable civics (e.g. [LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that found religions (e.g. [LINK=TECH_MEDITATION]Meditation[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DIVINE_RIGHT]Divine Right[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PAPER]Paper[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SANKORE]The University of Sankore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SPIRAL_MINARET]The Spiral Minaret[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_APOSTOLIC_PALACE]The Apostolic Palace[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SHWEDAGON_PAYA]Shwedagon Paya[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SISTINE_CHAPEL]The Sistine Chapel[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Temples[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Monasteries[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Nearly all of them--if it offers a worthwhile benefit and fits your strategy, switch to it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.[PARAGRAPH:1]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.</English>

On the contrary, as more civics and religions become available, you may want and need to change civics more often, and Spiritual lets you do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, this trait has slipped, in my opinion, from being one of the strongest to being a medium-strength trait. This is mainly because of the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Frankly, many disputed my inclusion of it in the "Strong" category to begin with. But Beyond the Sword has reduced its strength by making its effects easier to obtain. You now only need to use one Great Person, not two, in order to bring about your first Golden Age; and you can now change civics anarchy-free during a Golden Age. This is just one of many was that Golden Ages have been improved and made more attractive in Beyond the Sword.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, in the late game, when you have access to all the civics and Spiritual is normally at its strongest, you can now achieve the same effects by building the new Cristo Redentor wonder, which not only gives you Spiritual's ability to change civics anarchy-free; you can also change civics without having to wait for a single turn change, let alone the usual five! (Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)[PARAGRAPH:1]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that enable civics (e.g. [LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that found religions (e.g. [LINK=TECH_MEDITATION]Meditation[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DIVINE_RIGHT]Divine Right[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PAPER]Paper[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SANKORE]The University of Sankore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SPIRAL_MINARET]The Spiral Minaret[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_APOSTOLIC_PALACE]The Apostolic Palace[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SHWEDAGON_PAYA]Shwedagon Paya[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SISTINE_CHAPEL]The Sistine Chapel[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Temples[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Monasteries[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Nearly all of them--if it offers a worthwhile benefit and fits your strategy, switch to it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.[PARAGRAPH:1]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.</French>
