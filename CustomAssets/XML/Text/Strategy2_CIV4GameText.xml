		<English>[H1]Gold, Beakers, and Deficit Research[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Quechua[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this article, I hope to clarify the research value of gold. The discussion won't involve any hidden game mechanics, and it may already be well understood by experienced players. Still, we will give an unambiguous answer to certain key questions. Can you cut research times by clever manipulation of the slider? Can running merchant specialists be more benificial to your tech rate than running scientists? How much do buildings like courthouses or markets affect your research? What is a fair trading price for techs?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But before we begin, what is gold even good for in the first place? We can certainly use gold in trades, but why does gold have value for our trading partners? One important answer is that through Universal Suffrage or unit upgrades, gold can be an empire-wide substitute for production. These abilities can be critical, but they are not used on most turns, and we will not consider them much here. But every turn from the time the second city is founded, gold is necessary to pay the costs of our empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Ideal Slider Rate[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't already have enough gold in your treasury, you must use a fraction of your incoming commerce as gold to pay maintenance each turn. We will consider an 'ideal' percentage of commerce at which there is no net change in the treasury. Since the slider is limited to increments of 10% this is rarely exactly possible, but in practice it is no different from adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you do already have enough gold, you can just leave the slider at 100% and let the maintenance eat away at your treasury. If we consider our 'standard' science rate to be that at the ideal slider point, after a number of turns we find we have lost a certain amount of gold from the treasury and we have produced more beakers than we would have at the standard rate. It is as if the gold has been converted into beakers - this is what we mean by deficit research.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this situation defines a beaker value for any given amount of gold - the amount of extra beakers we produce if we set research to 100% until the given amount is fully spent on maintenance. But gold also has a beaker value in terms of the beakers we would lose if we set research to 0% until we have produced the given amount of gold. If you do the math (it's easy to check any statement I make here), you will find that the two beaker-per-gold ratios are exactly the same.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of researching at the ideal slider rate, we might turn off research for several turns to build a treasury, and then use that treasury for deficit research. But the fact that there is one beaker-per-gold ratio means that we produce exactly the same amount of beakers using either method (ignoring rounding errors). This is true for any two paths of research that begin and end at the same treasury value. And if they end at different treasury values we can easily find the difference in beakers produced by converting the treasury difference using the ratio. This is why it makes sense to talk about an ideal slider rate. Constantly adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point so that there is not much change in the treasury will produce almost exactly the same tech rate as the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These concepts allow us to blur the distinction between gold and beakers. In an abstract sense, we always research at the ideal slider rate, regardless of the position of the slider. If the slider is set below the ideal slider rate, some of our beakers are 'stored' as gold. If the slider is above the ideal rate we unlock some extra beakers through deficit research. If we are in the happy situation of running a surplus at 100% science, it is as if the ideal slider rate is higher than 100%. Since we can't ever set the slider higher than this ideal point, some of our ideal beakers must always be stored as surplus gold. We can never unlock extra beakers through deficit research in this situation, but the equivalence implied by the beaker-per-gold ratio still has abstract meaning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Finding the Ratio[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This magic ratio is much easier to find than you might think. It is simply the total amount of beakers that can be produced due to commerce, divided by the total amount of gold due to commerce. To find this, turn the slider to 100%, and record the net change in gold (typically negative), which we'll call M, and also find the total amount of beakers produced, B, using the Financial Advisor. Now switch the slider to 0%, and find the total amount of gold produced, G, and also record any beakers, b, which are produced at 0% research. The ratio we are looking for is just (B - b)/(G - M).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For example: b = 38 which results in G = 359, while B = 736 results in M = -93[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So in this case our beaker-gold ratio is (736-38)/(359+93) = 1.54[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My choice of parameters is conventional. Instead of using the numbers G and M, we may use the gold values listed in the Financial Advisor. And as will soon become clear, we may compare the four parameters at any two distinct slider values.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2] Gold and Beaker Multipliers [\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have no beaker or gold multiplying buildings (libraries, markets, etc), this ratio will be exactly 1, since commerce is converted into beakers and gold at the same rate. This suggests the beaker value of gold depends in some sense on the presence of multiplier buildings in your empire. In fact the ratio is just equal to the average beaker multiplier divided by the average gold multiplier, where the average is weighted by the fraction of commerce a city produces. So the beaker value of gold is fairly stable over time, it only changes if you build new multiplier buildings or significantly change the commerce distribution of your cities. It does not depend on many economically significant actions like hiring or firing specialists, building courthouses, producing wealth or research from production, and so forth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But what happens when the beaker-per-gold ratio does change? If you already have gold in your treasury, its value for deficit research also changes. You can take advantage of this by manipulating the amount of gold in your treasury. If your ratio increases, you will get more extra beakers from deficit research than before, but you will also lose more potential beakers in accumulating a given amount of gold. So if you accumulate the gold before the ratio change, you will gain some extra beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a little abstract, so let's consider an example. Suppose you're building Oxford in a commerce city (beakers from specialists complicate this example, but not the idea in general). You can set the slider to 0% a few turns before Oxford is complete, and then spend the gold on deficit research afterwards. Since you are producing no beakers to multiply, the situation is no different than if you had built Oxford a few turns earlier, when you had started 0% research. Spending the gold produced during these turns will give you the same amount of beakers as researching at the ideal rate, but here it is as if you already get the better science multiplier a few turns before Oxford is built![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to realize that it doesn't matter how or when you accumulate the gold before the ratio increase. The advantage comes from the change in the value of deficit research. Setting the slider to 0% just before a new beaker multiplier comes into effect simply allows you to plan fewer turns in advance (and makes the example above easier to understand).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A similar situation holds for decreases in the ratio. When you build gold-multiplying buildings, you lose less potential beakers in producing a given amount of gold, but you also get less extra beakers from deficit research. This may be a little confusing - you do not actually get less total beakers when you spend gold on deficit research, but since your ideal slider rate increases, less of those beakers are 'extra.' So it may be wise to spend your treasury on deficit research before the beaker value of gold decreases. This lets you take advantage of extra beakers you couldn't get during those turns by researching at the lower ideal rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Gold vs. Beakers[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So now we return to the questions we set out to answer. Running a merchant specialist reduces your net expenses, thus increasing your ideal slider rate - indirectly increasing your beakers per turn. Can a merchant produce more beakers than a scientist? The answer depends on what multiplier buildings you have in the city in question, as well as the average multipliers in you empire as a whole. If your cities have many beaker multipliers (libraries, monastaries...) but you've been neglecting your gold multipliers (grocers, banks...), then gold has a higher value in terms of beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As an extreme example, say you have a library, university, observatory, and laboratory in each one of your cities - but you have almost no gold multipliers...just a bank in one city. In that city with a bank, a merchant will produce 4 gold (rounded down) while a scientist will produce 6 beakers. But since the beaker-per-gold ratio in your empire will be very close to 2, the merchant will help your research rate more than a scientist. This will be true in any city that has better gold multipliers than your empire-wide average (unless the beaker multiplier there is also much higher than average).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]How much do buildings that reduce your maintenance affect your research rate? This question is easy to answer. If a developing city costs 8 gold in maintenance, a courthouse is effectively giving you 4 gold. With the magic ratio we can find the equivalent amount of beakers. And unless the city is bringing in significant commerce, or gold has low value in your empire, the courthouse will probably help your research more than a library.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What about buildings like markets and grocers? The extra gold from the building depends on the ideal slider rate, and this building will also change the current beaker-per-gold ratio. Unfortunately there is no simple formula that exactly determines the extra beakers produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But we can still make some assertions. For example, say you have libraries throughout your empire but not many markets. If your maintenance is bad enough that your ideal slider rate is near 50%, then building a grocer in a city has more immediate benefit to research than a university. If your ideal slider rate is higher, less commerce is devoted to gold and so gold-multipliers have less research value. This may just be considered common sense, but what is not obvious is the role of the beaker-to-gold ratio. If this ratio is high a grocer could still be better for research even for ideal rates approaching 70%. But for even higher ideal slider rates, it is doubtful that the value of gold could ever be high enough to compensate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tech Buying[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So far we have been speaking about the research value of small amounts of gold per turn. What about decisions like whether to use a Great Merchant for a lightbulb or a trade mission? Large amounts of gold and beakers involve more strategic elements. Gold is not 'converted' to beakers instantly through deficit research. Your net expenses per turn (the number M in the above formula) determines the time for the 'conversion' to take place. Unless you plan to use the production aspects of gold it is usually better to get the same amount of beakers now in the form of a tech, rather than over several turns by using gold for deficit research. A Great Merchant still may present a tough decision since the beaker value of a trade mission is typically much higher than the beakers gotten through lightbulbing - and the beakers eventually produced through settling will typically be much higher than both.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So the 'value' of large sums of gold has no simple mathematical definition. Even so, the beaker-gold ratio gives a decent rule-of-thumb for pricing techs in trades. If you are buying a tech from an AI for more gold than the value of the beaker cost, you are probably getting a bad deal. You could research the tech faster than you could produce the gold you are trading. On the other hand - if it prevents a fair tech trade - it may be disadvantageous to sell a tech for its 'fair' gold value. The seller potentially gives up a tech now for the same amount of beakers over a delayed time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is still possible to have a mutually beneficial tech buying trade, though. The player buying the tech may have a lower beaker value of gold than the seller, and the production aspects of gold may have higher strategic value for the seller. A less common situation would be where the buyer is running a surplus at 100%. In this case the buyer can't actually research at the ideal slider rate, so it would take longer to research the tech than it would to produce the equivalent gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More importantly, in a tech buying deal the seller does not lose the traded tech, while the buyer loses the value of the gold. This means it often makes sense to price a tech for less than the beaker value in gold. Even so, the AI tends to give you close to the beaker value in gold when you sell to them. So tech selling can sometimes get you more delayed beakers than a tech trade, while the AI also loses a similar amount.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE].......................[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this post wasn't entirely obvious to everyone. I know that I certainly didn't have a clear appreciation for how much things like merchants and courthouses improve your research rate until I did the math. I've included the derivation of the beaker-gold ratio in the spoiler below, but it's not necessary to understand the concepts in this article. And yes I spend too much time on this game - but if you got this far in the post, so do you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Feel free to argue or point out errors, thanks for reading![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Appendix[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The numbers G, M, B, and b are the same as in the text.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We define the 'ideal' research rate, x, as that at which there is no change in the treasury.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So (1 - x)(G - M) + M = 0, which means x = G/(G - M)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the ideal rate, we make x(B - b) + b beakers. This is x(B - b) more beakers than at 0%[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And at 100%, we make B - (x(B - b) + b) = (1 - x)(B - b) more beakers than the ideal rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What happens if we use a given amount of gold G0 for deficit research?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We can sustain 100% science for G0/(-M) turns, so we make (1 - x)(B - b)*G0/(-M) extra beakers.[NEWLINE]Using our expression for x, this simplifies to (B - b)/(G - M) * G0.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So (B - b)/(G - M) is our beaker to gold ratio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What happens if we turn off research until we build up a given amount G0?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It takes us G0/G turns to build the given wealth, so we lose x(B - b)*G0/G,[NEWLINE]simplifying to (B - b)/(G - M) * G0.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And again we see the ratio (B - b)/(G - M), and we note we can't get extra beakers by changing the slider.</English>

The ratio we are looking for is just (B - b)/(G - M).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For example: b = 38 which results in G = 359, while B = 736 results in M = -93[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So in this case our beaker-gold ratio is (736-38)/(359+93) = 1.54[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My choice of parameters is conventional. Instead of using the numbers G and M, we may use the gold values listed in the Financial Advisor. And as will soon become clear, we may compare the four parameters at any two distinct slider values.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2] Gold and Beaker Multipliers [\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have no beaker or gold multiplying buildings (libraries, markets, etc), this ratio will be exactly 1, since commerce is converted into beakers and gold at the same rate. This suggests the beaker value of gold depends in some sense on the presence of multiplier buildings in your empire. In fact the ratio is just equal to the average beaker multiplier divided by the average gold multiplier, where the average is weighted by the fraction of commerce a city produces. So the beaker value of gold is fairly stable over time, it only changes if you build new multiplier buildings or significantly change the commerce distribution of your cities. It does not depend on many economically significant actions like hiring or firing specialists, building courthouses, producing wealth or research from production, and so forth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But what happens when the beaker-per-gold ratio does change? If you already have gold in your treasury, its value for deficit research also changes. You can take advantage of this by manipulating the amount of gold in your treasury. If your ratio increases, you will get more extra beakers from deficit research than before, but you will also lose more potential beakers in accumulating a given amount of gold. So if you accumulate the gold before the ratio change, you will gain some extra beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a little abstract, so let's consider an example. Suppose you're building Oxford in a commerce city (beakers from specialists complicate this example, but not the idea in general). You can set the slider to 0% a few turns before Oxford is complete, and then spend the gold on deficit research afterwards. Since you are producing no beakers to multiply, the situation is no different than if you had built Oxford a few turns earlier, when you had started 0% research. Spending the gold produced during these turns will give you the same amount of beakers as researching at the ideal rate, but here it is as if you already get the better science multiplier a few turns before Oxford is built![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to realize that it doesn't matter how or when you accumulate the gold before the ratio increase. The advantage comes from the change in the value of deficit research. Setting the slider to 0% just before a new beaker multiplier comes into effect simply allows you to plan fewer turns in advance (and makes the example above easier to understand).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A similar situation holds for decreases in the ratio. When you build gold-multiplying buildings, you lose less potential beakers in producing a given amount of gold, but you also get less extra beakers from deficit research. This may be a little confusing - you do not actually get less total beakers when you spend gold on deficit research, but since your ideal slider rate increases, less of those beakers are 'extra.' So it may be wise to spend your treasury on deficit research before the beaker value of gold decreases. This lets you take advantage of extra beakers you couldn't get during those turns by researching at the lower ideal rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Gold vs. Beakers[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So now we return to the questions we set out to answer. Running a merchant specialist reduces your net expenses, thus increasing your ideal slider rate - indirectly increasing your beakers per turn. Can a merchant produce more beakers than a scientist? The answer depends on what multiplier buildings you have in the city in question, as well as the average multipliers in you empire as a whole. If your cities have many beaker multipliers (libraries, monastaries...) but you've been neglecting your gold multipliers (grocers, banks...), then gold has a higher value in terms of beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As an extreme example, say you have a library, university, observatory, and laboratory in each one of your cities - but you have almost no gold multipliers...just a bank in one city. In that city with a bank, a merchant will produce 4 gold (rounded down) while a scientist will produce 6 beakers. But since the beaker-per-gold ratio in your empire will be very close to 2, the merchant will help your research rate more than a scientist. This will be true in any city that has better gold multipliers than your empire-wide average (unless the beaker multiplier there is also much higher than average).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]How much do buildings that reduce your maintenance affect your research rate? This question is easy to answer. If a developing city costs 8 gold in maintenance, a courthouse is effectively giving you 4 gold. With the magic ratio we can find the equivalent amount of beakers. And unless the city is bringing in significant commerce, or gold has low value in your empire, the courthouse will probably help your research more than a library.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What about buildings like markets and grocers? The extra gold from the building depends on the ideal slider rate, and this building will also change the current beaker-per-gold ratio. Unfortunately there is no simple formula that exactly determines the extra beakers produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But we can still make some assertions. For example, say you have libraries throughout your empire but not many markets. If your maintenance is bad enough that your ideal slider rate is near 50%, then building a grocer in a city has more immediate benefit to research than a university. If your ideal slider rate is higher, less commerce is devoted to gold and so gold-multipliers have less research value. This may just be considered common sense, but what is not obvious is the role of the beaker-to-gold ratio. If this ratio is high a grocer could still be better for research even for ideal rates approaching 70%. But for even higher ideal slider rates, it is doubtful that the value of gold could ever be high enough to compensate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tech Buying[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So far we have been speaking about the research value of small amounts of gold per turn. What about decisions like whether to use a Great Merchant for a lightbulb or a trade mission? Large amounts of gold and beakers involve more strategic elements. Gold is not 'converted' to beakers instantly through deficit research. Your net expenses per turn (the number M in the above formula) determines the time for the 'conversion' to take place. Unless you plan to use the production aspects of gold it is usually better to get the same amount of beakers now in the form of a tech, rather than over several turns by using gold for deficit research. A Great Merchant still may present a tough decision since the beaker value of a trade mission is typically much higher than the beakers gotten through lightbulbing - and the beakers eventually produced through settling will typically be much higher than both.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So the 'value' of large sums of gold has no simple mathematical definition. Even so, the beaker-gold ratio gives a decent rule-of-thumb for pricing techs in trades. If you are buying a tech from an AI for more gold than the value of the beaker cost, you are probably getting a bad deal. You could research the tech faster than you could produce the gold you are trading. On the other hand - if it prevents a fair tech trade - it may be disadvantageous to sell a tech for its 'fair' gold value. The seller potentially gives up a tech now for the same amount of beakers over a delayed time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is still possible to have a mutually beneficial tech buying trade, though. The player buying the tech may have a lower beaker value of gold than the seller, and the production aspects of gold may have higher strategic value for the seller. A less common situation would be where the buyer is running a surplus at 100%. In this case the buyer can't actually research at the ideal slider rate, so it would take longer to research the tech than it would to produce the equivalent gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More importantly, in a tech buying deal the seller does not lose the traded tech, while the buyer loses the value of the gold. This means it often makes sense to price a tech for less than the beaker value in gold. Even so, the AI tends to give you close to the beaker value in gold when you sell to them. So tech selling can sometimes get you more delayed beakers than a tech trade, while the AI also loses a similar amount.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE].......................[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this post wasn't entirely obvious to everyone. I know that I certainly didn't have a clear appreciation for how much things like merchants and courthouses improve your research rate until I did the math.

		<German>[H1]Gold, Beakers, and Deficit Research[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Quechua[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this article, I hope to clarify the research value of gold. The discussion won't involve any hidden game mechanics, and it may already be well understood by experienced players. Still, we will give an unambiguous answer to certain key questions. Can you cut research times by clever manipulation of the slider? Can running merchant specialists be more benificial to your tech rate than running scientists? How much do buildings like courthouses or markets affect your research? What is a fair trading price for techs?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But before we begin, what is gold even good for in the first place? We can certainly use gold in trades, but why does gold have value for our trading partners? One important answer is that through Universal Suffrage or unit upgrades, gold can be an empire-wide substitute for production. These abilities can be critical, but they are not used on most turns, and we will not consider them much here. But every turn from the time the second city is founded, gold is necessary to pay the costs of our empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Ideal Slider Rate[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't already have enough gold in your treasury, you must use a fraction of your incoming commerce as gold to pay maintenance each turn. We will consider an 'ideal' percentage of commerce at which there is no net change in the treasury. Since the slider is limited to increments of 10% this is rarely exactly possible, but in practice it is no different from adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you do already have enough gold, you can just leave the slider at 100% and let the maintenance eat away at your treasury. If we consider our 'standard' science rate to be that at the ideal slider point, after a number of turns we find we have lost a certain amount of gold from the treasury and we have produced more beakers than we would have at the standard rate. It is as if the gold has been converted into beakers - this is what we mean by deficit research.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this situation defines a beaker value for any given amount of gold - the amount of extra beakers we produce if we set research to 100% until the given amount is fully spent on maintenance. But gold also has a beaker value in terms of the beakers we would lose if we set research to 0% until we have produced the given amount of gold. If you do the math (it's easy to check any statement I make here), you will find that the two beaker-per-gold ratios are exactly the same.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of researching at the ideal slider rate, we might turn off research for several turns to build a treasury, and then use that treasury for deficit research. But the fact that there is one beaker-per-gold ratio means that we produce exactly the same amount of beakers using either method (ignoring rounding errors). This is true for any two paths of research that begin and end at the same treasury value. And if they end at different treasury values we can easily find the difference in beakers produced by converting the treasury difference using the ratio. This is why it makes sense to talk about an ideal slider rate. Constantly adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point so that there is not much change in the treasury will produce almost exactly the same tech rate as the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These concepts allow us to blur the distinction between gold and beakers. In an abstract sense, we always research at the ideal slider rate, regardless of the position of the slider. If the slider is set below the ideal slider rate, some of our beakers are 'stored' as gold. If the slider is above the ideal rate we unlock some extra beakers through deficit research. If we are in the happy situation of running a surplus at 100% science, it is as if the ideal slider rate is higher than 100%. Since we can't ever set the slider higher than this ideal point, some of our ideal beakers must always be stored as surplus gold. We can never unlock extra beakers through deficit research in this situation, but the equivalence implied by the beaker-per-gold ratio still has abstract meaning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Finding the Ratio[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This magic ratio is much easier to find than you might think. It is simply the total amount of beakers that can be produced due to commerce, divided by the total amount of gold due to commerce. To find this, turn the slider to 100%, and record the net change in gold (typically negative), which we'll call M, and also find the total amount of beakers produced, B, using the Financial Advisor. Now switch the slider to 0%, and find the total amount of gold produced, G, and also record any beakers, b, which are produced at 0% research.

Setting the slider to 0% just before a new beaker multiplier comes into effect simply allows you to plan fewer turns in advance (and makes the example above easier to understand).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A similar situation holds for decreases in the ratio. When you build gold-multiplying buildings, you lose less potential beakers in producing a given amount of gold, but you also get less extra beakers from deficit research. This may be a little confusing - you do not actually get less total beakers when you spend gold on deficit research, but since your ideal slider rate increases, less of those beakers are 'extra.' So it may be wise to spend your treasury on deficit research before the beaker value of gold decreases. This lets you take advantage of extra beakers you couldn't get during those turns by researching at the lower ideal rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Gold vs. Beakers[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So now we return to the questions we set out to answer. Running a merchant specialist reduces your net expenses, thus increasing your ideal slider rate - indirectly increasing your beakers per turn. Can a merchant produce more beakers than a scientist? The answer depends on what multiplier buildings you have in the city in question, as well as the average multipliers in you empire as a whole. If your cities have many beaker multipliers (libraries, monastaries...) but you've been neglecting your gold multipliers (grocers, banks...), then gold has a higher value in terms of beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As an extreme example, say you have a library, university, observatory, and laboratory in each one of your cities - but you have almost no gold multipliers...just a bank in one city. In that city with a bank, a merchant will produce 4 gold (rounded down) while a scientist will produce 6 beakers. But since the beaker-per-gold ratio in your empire will be very close to 2, the merchant will help your research rate more than a scientist. This will be true in any city that has better gold multipliers than your empire-wide average (unless the beaker multiplier there is also much higher than average).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]How much do buildings that reduce your maintenance affect your research rate? This question is easy to answer. If a developing city costs 8 gold in maintenance, a courthouse is effectively giving you 4 gold. With the magic ratio we can find the equivalent amount of beakers. And unless the city is bringing in significant commerce, or gold has low value in your empire, the courthouse will probably help your research more than a library.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What about buildings like markets and grocers? The extra gold from the building depends on the ideal slider rate, and this building will also change the current beaker-per-gold ratio. Unfortunately there is no simple formula that exactly determines the extra beakers produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But we can still make some assertions. For example, say you have libraries throughout your empire but not many markets. If your maintenance is bad enough that your ideal slider rate is near 50%, then building a grocer in a city has more immediate benefit to research than a university. If your ideal slider rate is higher, less commerce is devoted to gold and so gold-multipliers have less research value. This may just be considered common sense, but what is not obvious is the role of the beaker-to-gold ratio. If this ratio is high a grocer could still be better for research even for ideal rates approaching 70%. But for even higher ideal slider rates, it is doubtful that the value of gold could ever be high enough to compensate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tech Buying[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So far we have been speaking about the research value of small amounts of gold per turn. What about decisions like whether to use a Great Merchant for a lightbulb or a trade mission? Large amounts of gold and beakers involve more strategic elements. Gold is not 'converted' to beakers instantly through deficit research. Your net expenses per turn (the number M in the above formula) determines the time for the 'conversion' to take place. Unless you plan to use the production aspects of gold it is usually better to get the same amount of beakers now in the form of a tech, rather than over several turns by using gold for deficit research. A Great Merchant still may present a tough decision since the beaker value of a trade mission is typically much higher than the beakers gotten through lightbulbing - and the beakers eventually produced through settling will typically be much higher than both.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So the 'value' of large sums of gold has no simple mathematical definition. Even so, the beaker-gold ratio gives a decent rule-of-thumb for pricing techs in trades. If you are buying a tech from an AI for more gold than the value of the beaker cost, you are probably getting a bad deal. You could research the tech faster than you could produce the gold you are trading. On the other hand - if it prevents a fair tech trade - it may be disadvantageous to sell a tech for its 'fair' gold value. The seller potentially gives up a tech now for the same amount of beakers over a delayed time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is still possible to have a mutually beneficial tech buying trade, though. The player buying the tech may have a lower beaker value of gold than the seller, and the production aspects of gold may have higher strategic value for the seller. A less common situation would be where the buyer is running a surplus at 100%. In this case the buyer can't actually research at the ideal slider rate, so it would take longer to research the tech than it would to produce the equivalent gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More importantly, in a tech buying deal the seller does not lose the traded tech, while the buyer loses the value of the gold. This means it often makes sense to price a tech for less than the beaker value in gold. Even so, the AI tends to give you close to the beaker value in gold when you sell to them. So tech selling can sometimes get you more delayed beakers than a tech trade, while the AI also loses a similar amount.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE].......................[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this post wasn't entirely obvious to everyone. I know that I certainly didn't have a clear appreciation for how much things like merchants and courthouses improve your research rate until I did the math. I've included the derivation of the beaker-gold ratio in the spoiler below, but it's not necessary to understand the concepts in this article. And yes I spend too much time on this game - but if you got this far in the post, so do you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Feel free to argue or point out errors, thanks for reading![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Appendix[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The numbers G, M, B, and b are the same as in the text.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We define the 'ideal' research rate, x, as that at which there is no change in the treasury.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So (1 - x)(G - M) + M = 0, which means x = G/(G - M)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the ideal rate, we make x(B - b) + b beakers.

		<Spanish>[H1]Gold, Beakers, and Deficit Research[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Quechua[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this article, I hope to clarify the research value of gold. The discussion won't involve any hidden game mechanics, and it may already be well understood by experienced players. Still, we will give an unambiguous answer to certain key questions. Can you cut research times by clever manipulation of the slider? Can running merchant specialists be more benificial to your tech rate than running scientists? How much do buildings like courthouses or markets affect your research? What is a fair trading price for techs?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But before we begin, what is gold even good for in the first place? We can certainly use gold in trades, but why does gold have value for our trading partners? One important answer is that through Universal Suffrage or unit upgrades, gold can be an empire-wide substitute for production. These abilities can be critical, but they are not used on most turns, and we will not consider them much here. But every turn from the time the second city is founded, gold is necessary to pay the costs of our empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Ideal Slider Rate[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't already have enough gold in your treasury, you must use a fraction of your incoming commerce as gold to pay maintenance each turn. We will consider an 'ideal' percentage of commerce at which there is no net change in the treasury. Since the slider is limited to increments of 10% this is rarely exactly possible, but in practice it is no different from adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you do already have enough gold, you can just leave the slider at 100% and let the maintenance eat away at your treasury. If we consider our 'standard' science rate to be that at the ideal slider point, after a number of turns we find we have lost a certain amount of gold from the treasury and we have produced more beakers than we would have at the standard rate. It is as if the gold has been converted into beakers - this is what we mean by deficit research.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this situation defines a beaker value for any given amount of gold - the amount of extra beakers we produce if we set research to 100% until the given amount is fully spent on maintenance. But gold also has a beaker value in terms of the beakers we would lose if we set research to 0% until we have produced the given amount of gold. If you do the math (it's easy to check any statement I make here), you will find that the two beaker-per-gold ratios are exactly the same.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of researching at the ideal slider rate, we might turn off research for several turns to build a treasury, and then use that treasury for deficit research. But the fact that there is one beaker-per-gold ratio means that we produce exactly the same amount of beakers using either method (ignoring rounding errors). This is true for any two paths of research that begin and end at the same treasury value. And if they end at different treasury values we can easily find the difference in beakers produced by converting the treasury difference using the ratio. This is why it makes sense to talk about an ideal slider rate. Constantly adjusting the slider above and below the ideal point so that there is not much change in the treasury will produce almost exactly the same tech rate as the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These concepts allow us to blur the distinction between gold and beakers. In an abstract sense, we always research at the ideal slider rate, regardless of the position of the slider. If the slider is set below the ideal slider rate, some of our beakers are 'stored' as gold. If the slider is above the ideal rate we unlock some extra beakers through deficit research. If we are in the happy situation of running a surplus at 100% science, it is as if the ideal slider rate is higher than 100%. Since we can't ever set the slider higher than this ideal point, some of our ideal beakers must always be stored as surplus gold. We can never unlock extra beakers through deficit research in this situation, but the equivalence implied by the beaker-per-gold ratio still has abstract meaning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Finding the Ratio[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This magic ratio is much easier to find than you might think. It is simply the total amount of beakers that can be produced due to commerce, divided by the total amount of gold due to commerce. To find this, turn the slider to 100%, and record the net change in gold (typically negative), which we'll call M, and also find the total amount of beakers produced, B, using the Financial Advisor. Now switch the slider to 0%, and find the total amount of gold produced, G, and also record any beakers, b, which are produced at 0% research. The ratio we are looking for is just (B - b)/(G - M).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For example: b = 38 which results in G = 359, while B = 736 results in M = -93[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So in this case our beaker-gold ratio is (736-38)/(359+93) = 1.54[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My choice of parameters is conventional. Instead of using the numbers G and M, we may use the gold values listed in the Financial Advisor. And as will soon become clear, we may compare the four parameters at any two distinct slider values.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2] Gold and Beaker Multipliers [\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have no beaker or gold multiplying buildings (libraries, markets, etc), this ratio will be exactly 1, since commerce is converted into beakers and gold at the same rate. This suggests the beaker value of gold depends in some sense on the presence of multiplier buildings in your empire. In fact the ratio is just equal to the average beaker multiplier divided by the average gold multiplier, where the average is weighted by the fraction of commerce a city produces. So the beaker value of gold is fairly stable over time, it only changes if you build new multiplier buildings or significantly change the commerce distribution of your cities. It does not depend on many economically significant actions like hiring or firing specialists, building courthouses, producing wealth or research from production, and so forth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But what happens when the beaker-per-gold ratio does change? If you already have gold in your treasury, its value for deficit research also changes. You can take advantage of this by manipulating the amount of gold in your treasury. If your ratio increases, you will get more extra beakers from deficit research than before, but you will also lose more potential beakers in accumulating a given amount of gold. So if you accumulate the gold before the ratio change, you will gain some extra beakers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a little abstract, so let's consider an example. Suppose you're building Oxford in a commerce city (beakers from specialists complicate this example, but not the idea in general). You can set the slider to 0% a few turns before Oxford is complete, and then spend the gold on deficit research afterwards. Since you are producing no beakers to multiply, the situation is no different than if you had built Oxford a few turns earlier, when you had started 0% research. Spending the gold produced during these turns will give you the same amount of beakers as researching at the ideal rate, but here it is as if you already get the better science multiplier a few turns before Oxford is built![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to realize that it doesn't matter how or when you accumulate the gold before the ratio increase. The advantage comes from the change in the value of deficit research. Setting the slider to 0% just before a new beaker multiplier comes into effect simply allows you to plan fewer turns in advance (and makes the example above easier to understand).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A similar situation holds for decreases in the ratio. When you build gold-multiplying buildings, you lose less potential beakers in producing a given amount of gold, but you also get less extra beakers from deficit research. This may be a little confusing - you do not actually get less total beakers when you spend gold on deficit research, but since your ideal slider rate increases, less of those beakers are 'extra.' So it may be wise to spend your treasury on deficit research before the beaker value of gold decreases.

		<English>[H1]Specialization of Cities[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]iwas[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the biggest ways Civ4 is different from Civ3 is in the way we choose locations for cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Civ3, city placement was a sort of checklist, and the cities with the most checks were usually the best. Fresh water, check. Hills/mountains for production, check. Food tiles for growth, check. Resources, check. On the coast, check. And so on; you wanted the best checklist cities possible because with the exception of cultural victory cities and maybe super science cities (with double sci wonders), [BOLD]all cities really did the same thing[\BOLD]. This is not so in Civ4, and when I first made the transition the need to specialize cities was one of the things that was most confusing to me. But I'm getting ahead of myself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Why Specialize?[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are a number of factors that force us to specialize our cities. They are, in no particular order:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Great People system[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The nature of GP makes it far more beneficial to have one city produce a ton of GPP than have a bunch of cities all make a little bit of GPP.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Roads no longer produce commerce.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]In Civ3, we didn't need to make commerce-specific cities because every large, fully roaded (or RRed) city produced a lot of commerce on its own. This is not so in Civ4; you need to build a specific improvement (cottage) in order to increase a tile's commerce.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]National wonder complement each other, but you can only build 2 per city.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]It is a great idea to have Heroic Epic and West Point in the same city; it will build military units faster and give them bonus experience to boot. Since the national wonders usually give a percent benefit to one aspect of a city's production, it obviously behooves us to ensure that the aspect receiving the bonus is as high as possible.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]# of city upkeep forces us to limit the number of cities we found.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]This is probably the biggest difference from Civ3. There was a penalty from founding too many cities in Civ3 (corruption), but it was nowhere near as crippling as the penalty is in Civ4. Since we are severely limited in the number of cities we can make, we obviously want to make the most of those cities. (One thing that strikes me as odd about this is the dissolution of colonies in Civ4. If the game is designed to discourage founding a city specifically to get an important resource, shouldn't there be a built in alternative?)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Culture provides a defensive bonus.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]This means that in addition to any logistical benefits, a few high culture cities will always be easier to defend than a horde of low culture cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Religion![\BOLD][NEWLINE]Simply put it is easier to spread religion to all of your cities if you have less cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So now that we have a good idea of why it specializing is good, let's look at the three basic types of cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The House of Commerce[\BOLD], aka Moneybag City, Goldsville[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Essentially, this is a city that is designed to get as much commerce as possible. You will end up building cottages on almost every tile in the city's fat t, but it is important to have enough food to ensure that the city grows quickly. This city will have lots of gold (and therefore science), so it behooves you to build +% gold/science improvements here (depending on what you are doing at the time)![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When looking for places for commerce cities, remember that while eventual gold production is important, you also need to consider the speed at which the city will reach its optimal size. You could have the highest gold city in the world and it would be useless if it takes all game to get to size 6.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You have to balance this need for food with early cottage placement, however. Cottages take a long time to grow fully, and need to be worked in order to grow. You need to be wary of the opposite of the high-gold-no-people commerce city; the high-people-no-towns commerce city. Balance working food tiles and cottages while your commerce city grows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Consider rivers carefully. Rivers provide a bonus to both commerce and, through farming, food. You need to decide whether to use a river for your commerce city or for...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The GP Farm[\BOLD] aka Specialistville, Wondertown.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This city is built on pure population, converted into specialists to produce GPP. In low levels you can usually count on wonders to produce a good amount of GPP, but specialists are more reliably attainable and above all, convertible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Look for fertile ground with lots of bonus food. If you also want to get wonders for GPP, you will need a good amount of production as well, so some hills would probably be nice too.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, it would be a good idea to get +GPP improvements/wonders here. National Epic should go here for sure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One more thing - never put super-specialists in your GP Farm. GP Farms usually produce a fair amount of culture/beakers/commerce just by having so many specialists, but never forget that their primary purpose is making GP. Put the super-specialists in a place that could really use the extra production, like...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Factory[\BOLD], aka Anviltown, Hill-Land, Detroit[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What the house of commerce is for money and the GP farm is for food, the factory is for production. This city, when fully developed, should be capable of producing a ton of hammers per turn, and be fully endowed with national wonders that increase either production or the benefits of it. I have already mentioned my personal favorite combination of national wonders for the factory: Heroic Epic and West Point. Other combinations are possible too, most using Iron Works in some way. It is sometimes necessary to distinguish between a military factory and a wonder/SS/other factory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What I said about the commerce city and growth holds true for the factory as well; you need to emphasis production, yes, but the city also has to grow. Remember, you can put a factory on the coast too, for mass production of ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, it is very difficult to have every single city in your empire be specialized in one direction (especially if you didn't found the cities). Use common sense and don't be too afraid to found a hybrid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to knowing what sort of cities you can build, you should know when to go for what type. It is when deciding which strategy to go for that Civ4 really begins to shine; there are so many considerations and layers of strategy that it is impossible to say what is best for every situation, but I think I can spew out some general guidelines:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Consider your leader traits when deciding where to found your core! A financial civ should make getting a commerce city a priority; a philosophical leader should seriously consider a GP farm almost immediately. It is important to maximize your benefit from both of your leader's traits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choose your civics carefully, as to maximize your advantages and minimize your disadvantages. If your GP farm is booming, but your commerce city is lagging behind (and thus slowing your research), you should seriously consider Representation. Don't become addicted to any one civic! They are all viable, and will remain so throughout the game (except for the civics that Emancipation kind of kills.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Have an overall plan! I cannot stress this enough. In Civ4, more than ever, it is important to start reaching for your eventual goals at the beginning of the game. You want some flexibility of course; it doesn't work to be hell-bent on military conquest and then discover you lack Copper and Iron. But whenever you found a city, ask yourself, "How does this city help me reach my overall goal?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope you guys find this article helpful.</English>

You will end up building cottages on almost every tile in the city's fat t, but it is important to have enough food to ensure that the city grows quickly. This city will have lots of gold (and therefore science), so it behooves you to build +% gold/science improvements here (depending on what you are doing at the time)![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When looking for places for commerce cities, remember that while eventual gold production is important, you also need to consider the speed at which the city will reach its optimal size. You could have the highest gold city in the world and it would be useless if it takes all game to get to size 6.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You have to balance this need for food with early cottage placement, however. Cottages take a long time to grow fully, and need to be worked in order to grow. You need to be wary of the opposite of the high-gold-no-people commerce city; the high-people-no-towns commerce city. Balance working food tiles and cottages while your commerce city grows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Consider rivers carefully. Rivers provide a bonus to both commerce and, through farming, food. You need to decide whether to use a river for your commerce city or for...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The GP Farm[\BOLD] aka Specialistville, Wondertown.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This city is built on pure population, converted into specialists to produce GPP. In low levels you can usually count on wonders to produce a good amount of GPP, but specialists are more reliably attainable and above all, convertible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Look for fertile ground with lots of bonus food. If you also want to get wonders for GPP, you will need a good amount of production as well, so some hills would probably be nice too.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, it would be a good idea to get +GPP improvements/wonders here. National Epic should go here for sure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One more thing - never put super-specialists in your GP Farm. GP Farms usually produce a fair amount of culture/beakers/commerce just by having so many specialists, but never forget that their primary purpose is making GP. Put the super-specialists in a place that could really use the extra production, like...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Factory[\BOLD], aka Anviltown, Hill-Land, Detroit[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What the house of commerce is for money and the GP farm is for food, the factory is for production. This city, when fully developed, should be capable of producing a ton of hammers per turn, and be fully endowed with national wonders that increase either production or the benefits of it. I have already mentioned my personal favorite combination of national wonders for the factory: Heroic Epic and West Point. Other combinations are possible too, most using Iron Works in some way. It is sometimes necessary to distinguish between a military factory and a wonder/SS/other factory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What I said about the commerce city and growth holds true for the factory as well; you need to emphasis production, yes, but the city also has to grow. Remember, you can put a factory on the coast too, for mass production of ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, it is very difficult to have every single city in your empire be specialized in one direction (especially if you didn't found the cities). Use common sense and don't be too afraid to found a hybrid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to knowing what sort of cities you can build, you should know when to go for what type. It is when deciding which strategy to go for that Civ4 really begins to shine; there are so many considerations and layers of strategy that it is impossible to say what is best for every situation, but I think I can spew out some general guidelines:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Consider your leader traits when deciding where to found your core! A financial civ should make getting a commerce city a priority; a philosophical leader should seriously consider a GP farm almost immediately. It is important to maximize your benefit from both of your leader's traits.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choose your civics carefully, as to maximize your advantages and minimize your disadvantages. If your GP farm is booming, but your commerce city is lagging behind (and thus slowing your research), you should seriously consider Representation. Don't become addicted to any one civic! They are all viable, and will remain so throughout the game (except for the civics that Emancipation kind of kills.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Have an overall plan! I cannot stress this enough. In Civ4, more than ever, it is important to start reaching for your eventual goals at the beginning of the game. You want some flexibility of course; it doesn't work to be hell-bent on military conquest and then discover you lack Copper and Iron.

		<English>[H1]Triangle Diplomacy[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Polypheus[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many new players, it seems, do not practice diplomacy in an organized, coherent way but in a "spur of the moment" haphazard way. For example, an AI request will come up which asks you to "stop trade with someone" or "give tribute/help", "declare war", etc and I think many beginners just decide at the moment what "feels" best with no long term planning. But this isn't the best or most interesting approach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What you should do, upon founding your empire and exploring the land is to see who and where the AI Civs are located and how powerful they are, then decide who is going to be your your long-term ally. Then using the F4 screen, figure out who another Civ that the potential ally really likes (and presumably that third civ likes back) that you also would want as an ally. Then you will attempt to (as much as possible) get relations between you and these two Civs as high as possible, forsaking all others when necessary. The key to remember is that you must ally with two Civs that themselves are extremely friendly to another thus avoiding the "trading with enemy" penalty and also the awkward situation where each ally asks you to war on the other! This usually but not necessarily requires you to have the same official religion as these other two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And that means that when they ask for reasonable tribute, you give it. That means when they ask you to stop trade with those outside the triangle, you do it. That means when they ask you to join in war, you do it if it is safe to do so (and it is a huge bonus to do it as it prevents the -1 you failed to help us in war but rather gives +1to4 for mutual struggle). Realize though that when you do that, that other Civ will be a lifelong enemy most likely but that okay. Of course, it means that relations with some of those Civs outside of the triangle will probably be irreparably harmed but it is much better to have strong friends and strong haters than to have everyone cautious or annoyed at you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now it is important to avoid having "backstabbing" or "rogue" or particularly warlike nations in the triangle.

		<French>[H1]Triangle Diplomacy[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Polypheus[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many new players, it seems, do not practice diplomacy in an organized, coherent way but in a "spur of the moment" haphazard way. For example, an AI request will come up which asks you to "stop trade with someone" or "give tribute/help", "declare war", etc and I think many beginners just decide at the moment what "feels" best with no long term planning. But this isn't the best or most interesting approach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What you should do, upon founding your empire and exploring the land is to see who and where the AI Civs are located and how powerful they are, then decide who is going to be your your long-term ally. Then using the F4 screen, figure out who another Civ that the potential ally really likes (and presumably that third civ likes back) that you also would want as an ally. Then you will attempt to (as much as possible) get relations between you and these two Civs as high as possible, forsaking all others when necessary. The key to remember is that you must ally with two Civs that themselves are extremely friendly to another thus avoiding the "trading with enemy" penalty and also the awkward situation where each ally asks you to war on the other! This usually but not necessarily requires you to have the same official religion as these other two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And that means that when they ask for reasonable tribute, you give it. That means when they ask you to stop trade with those outside the triangle, you do it. That means when they ask you to join in war, you do it if it is safe to do so (and it is a huge bonus to do it as it prevents the -1 you failed to help us in war but rather gives +1to4 for mutual struggle). Realize though that when you do that, that other Civ will be a lifelong enemy most likely but that okay. Of course, it means that relations with some of those Civs outside of the triangle will probably be irreparably harmed but it is much better to have strong friends and strong haters than to have everyone cautious or annoyed at you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now it is important to avoid having "backstabbing" or "rogue" or particularly warlike nations in the triangle. Although all AIs will backstab if you are too weak or present too much of a target (so in all cases having a credible military is a must), some do it much more than others.

		<English>[H1]Ways into Production[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]cabert[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This could be an industrial thread, but no, it's only a game.[NEWLINE]After health and happiness articles, by popular demand (a whole person asked for it), I'm back with some kind of "do it yourself" article about production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll put more work into this in a few weeks, but I don't want my franchise to get lost, do I ?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Production as we all know, is the key to winning the game a lot more so than happiness, health, beakers or gold (just joking, check the other articles (credits to me is already done, credits to hackapell for his economic summary).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article identifies the sources of production, the bonuses that you can get and some nice combos to benefit the most from them.[NEWLINE]I'm not going into specialization for now, so I'm assuming it is clear for everyone that some cities aren't going to be production powerhouses. Don't expect your cottage spammed city to produce its library in 1 turn.[NEWLINE]However, generally speaking, you will try to have the most production possible. This is what you see as [ICON_PRODUCTION] in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Where do you get those [ICON_PRODUCTION] you need to build troops, buildings or wonders (or gold or beakers or culture)?[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5 sources:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]hammers from worked tiles[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]hammers from specialists (settled Great engineers, great prophets, great scientists, or engineers, priests and citizens)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]chopped forest from around your city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]conversion from population to hammers via slavery[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]conversion from gold to hammers via universal suffrage[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a 6th source in BtS, for religious buildings of the "world religion" (the state religion of the Apostolic Palace owner). I won't go into much details on this.

This is the maximum output. The further the trees are from your city, the less you hammers you get from it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chopping a forest costs 3 worker turns on normal speed. So either you send 3 workers on a tile and chop it down in 1 turn (+1 turn to move into the forest if you're not playing India with its fast workers) or send 1 worker and let it chop for 3 turns.[NEWLINE]Note that both the output of chopping and the number of worker turns needed scale with game speed.[NEWLINE]Also note that all the bonuses you have in the target city apply to the hammers from chopping.[NEWLINE]What is prechopping you've heard about? It's about applying worker turns to a forest then leaving before the forest really is chopped. This is useful for a wonder you really want: you prechop all the forests around your city, then as soon as you have the tech you need, you send a worker in and apply the final worker turn to chop. This way you can get all your forests cut down in a single turn with 1 worker/forest. Note that if you don't build a road into the forest you still lose 12 turn to move in.[NEWLINE]Prechopping can also be used to keep your workers busy while researching a worker tech in the beginning.[NEWLINE]Another thing about chopping is to chose where the hammers from a chop are going.[NEWLINE]This is rather simple. They go into the city that has the tile amongst its active tiles. This means that even you don't work the tile in your target, you should not let a different city use it if you want the hammers.[NEWLINE]If no city has the tile in its active tile, they go into the closest city. If 2 cities are equidistant, it's the oldest that gets the hammers.[NEWLINE]Beware: you can chop inside foreign cultural borders, but you won't earn the hammers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Whipping population[\BOLD] aka pop rushing:[NEWLINE]You need to be running the slavery civic, which requires bronze working. You can only whip away half the population in a given city.[NEWLINE]Although you can whip more than once in a given city in a given turn, you can only finish one item at the end of the turn.[NEWLINE]One population point is worth 30 base hammers on normal speed.[NEWLINE]This scales with game speed, and all the bonuses you have in the city apply to the whip.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for whipping before having invested hammers.[NEWLINE]There is also a penalty for whipping a wonder.[NEWLINE]There is a unhappiness penalty of 1 for 10 turns. This penalty stacks in a very painful way:[NEWLINE]If you whip twice, you get 2 unhappies for 10 turns, then you get down to 1 unhappy for 10 more turns.[NEWLINE]What can you do and what do you get? You can finish a building/unit/wonder (not a project) at the end of the turn by pushing the pop rushing button provided you run slavery and have the necessary population = twice the cost of the whip.[NEWLINE]For example, in a size 10 city, you can whip 5 population points away which is 150 base hammers worth of production, provided you spend at least 1 turn putting hammers into the build.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What would a whipper's turns look like?[NEWLINE]Turn 1 : you assign all your citizens to max food tiles, earning a few "normal" hammers (let's say 3), and start producing an item (let's say a catapult)[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you whip away 2 population points, get 60 base hammers towards the catapult + 3 from turn 1 + 3 from turn 2.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you have a catapult, and 26 hammers overflow + the 3 you're still producing. You can start anything, with 29 base hammers. If you did it right, you grew back 1 pop immediately to reach your happiness cap again immediately.[NEWLINE]turn 4 to 10: grow if possible (happiness cap!), or work max hammer tiles to prevent growth or build settlers/workers.[NEWLINE]turn 11: back to turn 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a very good article from VoiceofUnreason (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=193659) on whipping you can check, for more information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cash Rushing[\BOLD][NEWLINE]You need to run universal suffrage (available through democracy or pyramids) and to have money in the bank.[NEWLINE]You can buy units, buildings and wonders, but not projects.[NEWLINE]The price is high: 3 gold/hammer.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing without hammers invested (same as for pop rushing).[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing wonders.[NEWLINE]Bonuses don't apply.[NEWLINE]So you can buy walls for the same price, if you have stone or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What do you get? you get the item at the end of your turn, there is an overflow of exactly your base hammers.[NEWLINE]You can manage more overflow by queue juggling.[NEWLINE]An example?[NEWLINE]Let's say you have 5 honest base hammers.[NEWLINE]Turn 1: you start a forge. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you start a granary. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you start a library. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]turn 4: you start a courthouse. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 5: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the forge.[NEWLINE]turn 6: you pay (60-5)x3= 165 gold to finish the granary.[NEWLINE]turn 7: you pay (90-5)x3 = 255 gold to finish the library.[NEWLINE]turn 8: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the courthouse.[NEWLINE]turn 9: you can build what you want with (20 hammers overflow + 5 base hammers )*1,25 from the forge = 31 hammers.[NEWLINE]My example doesn't seem very impressive? Ok, I must agree.[NEWLINE]Now try it with your massive base hammers city, and get a 4 turns discount on the engine production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll try to show here a few combos to let you get things done as fast and good as possible when it is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]preliminary philosophy course:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- You're not aways spiritual, but sometimes you are (or sometimes you play BtS and can switch civics for free, during a golden age or when you have christo redentor). This is good for using the best civics for a specific production.[NEWLINE]- Everything has a price. You really must be aware that you're not getting representation's free beakers when you're $rushing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Short list of combos:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- BW is a combo by itself, allowing to chop forests and to whip population. Every early rush needs this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=244075).[NEWLINE]- OrgRel when building up infra, then either pacifism or theocracy for using your infra. This can be coupled with slavery for the fastest results. Rushing a forge under orgreal to have even more bonus is kind of cool. Even better if you have gold, gems, silver to get over the happiness cost.[NEWLINE]- police state + slavery + theocracy (or vassalage) for a few cheap high level units. Overkill, if you go police state + vassalage+slavery +theocracy, but with a ger you can reach level 4 out of barracks.[NEWLINE]- bureaucracy combinations: bureau + orgrel + the right resource for a +175% hammers towards your favourite wonder. bureaucracy + police state + HE for fastest unit production ever.[NEWLINE]- nationhood + theocracy for empire wide expansion. Cheaper and faster than slavery: drafting (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=217566).[NEWLINE]- (kremlin +) universal suffrage + state property (+ caste system if you play BtS) for "production anywhere". You keep your cottages in your ancient cities, load your new cities with workshops and watermills, buy the forges, factories and stuff you need, and build the spaceship faster that you research the techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day soon, I'll move my lazy a$$ and write some details about those combos, but I'm sure you see the trick already.</English>

This is the maximum output. The further the trees are from your city, the less you hammers you get from it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chopping a forest costs 3 worker turns on normal speed. So either you send 3 workers on a tile and chop it down in 1 turn (+1 turn to move into the forest if you're not playing India with its fast workers) or send 1 worker and let it chop for 3 turns.[NEWLINE]Note that both the output of chopping and the number of worker turns needed scale with game speed.[NEWLINE]Also note that all the bonuses you have in the target city apply to the hammers from chopping.[NEWLINE]What is prechopping you've heard about? It's about applying worker turns to a forest then leaving before the forest really is chopped. This is useful for a wonder you really want: you prechop all the forests around your city, then as soon as you have the tech you need, you send a worker in and apply the final worker turn to chop. This way you can get all your forests cut down in a single turn with 1 worker/forest. Note that if you don't build a road into the forest you still lose 12 turn to move in.[NEWLINE]Prechopping can also be used to keep your workers busy while researching a worker tech in the beginning.[NEWLINE]Another thing about chopping is to chose where the hammers from a chop are going.[NEWLINE]This is rather simple. They go into the city that has the tile amongst its active tiles. This means that even you don't work the tile in your target, you should not let a different city use it if you want the hammers.[NEWLINE]If no city has the tile in its active tile, they go into the closest city. If 2 cities are equidistant, it's the oldest that gets the hammers.[NEWLINE]Beware: you can chop inside foreign cultural borders, but you won't earn the hammers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Whipping population[\BOLD] aka pop rushing:[NEWLINE]You need to be running the slavery civic, which requires bronze working. You can only whip away half the population in a given city.[NEWLINE]Although you can whip more than once in a given city in a given turn, you can only finish one item at the end of the turn.[NEWLINE]One population point is worth 30 base hammers on normal speed.[NEWLINE]This scales with game speed, and all the bonuses you have in the city apply to the whip.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for whipping before having invested hammers.[NEWLINE]There is also a penalty for whipping a wonder.[NEWLINE]There is a unhappiness penalty of 1 for 10 turns. This penalty stacks in a very painful way:[NEWLINE]If you whip twice, you get 2 unhappies for 10 turns, then you get down to 1 unhappy for 10 more turns.[NEWLINE]What can you do and what do you get? You can finish a building/unit/wonder (not a project) at the end of the turn by pushing the pop rushing button provided you run slavery and have the necessary population = twice the cost of the whip.[NEWLINE]For example, in a size 10 city, you can whip 5 population points away which is 150 base hammers worth of production, provided you spend at least 1 turn putting hammers into the build.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What would a whipper's turns look like?[NEWLINE]Turn 1 : you assign all your citizens to max food tiles, earning a few "normal" hammers (let's say 3), and start producing an item (let's say a catapult)[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you whip away 2 population points, get 60 base hammers towards the catapult + 3 from turn 1 + 3 from turn 2.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you have a catapult, and 26 hammers overflow + the 3 you're still producing. You can start anything, with 29 base hammers. If you did it right, you grew back 1 pop immediately to reach your happiness cap again immediately.[NEWLINE]turn 4 to 10: grow if possible (happiness cap!), or work max hammer tiles to prevent growth or build settlers/workers.[NEWLINE]turn 11: back to turn 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a very good article from VoiceofUnreason (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=193659) on whipping you can check, for more information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cash Rushing[\BOLD][NEWLINE]You need to run universal suffrage (available through democracy or pyramids) and to have money in the bank.[NEWLINE]You can buy units, buildings and wonders, but not projects.[NEWLINE]The price is high: 3 gold/hammer.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing without hammers invested (same as for pop rushing).[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing wonders.[NEWLINE]Bonuses don't apply.[NEWLINE]So you can buy walls for the same price, if you have stone or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What do you get? you get the item at the end of your turn, there is an overflow of exactly your base hammers.[NEWLINE]You can manage more overflow by queue juggling.[NEWLINE]An example?[NEWLINE]Let's say you have 5 honest base hammers.[NEWLINE]Turn 1: you start a forge. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you start a granary. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you start a library. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]turn 4: you start a courthouse. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 5: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the forge.[NEWLINE]turn 6: you pay (60-5)x3= 165 gold to finish the granary.[NEWLINE]turn 7: you pay (90-5)x3 = 255 gold to finish the library.[NEWLINE]turn 8: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the courthouse.[NEWLINE]turn 9: you can build what you want with (20 hammers overflow + 5 base hammers )*1,25 from the forge = 31 hammers.[NEWLINE]My example doesn't seem very impressive? Ok, I must agree.[NEWLINE]Now try it with your massive base hammers city, and get a 4 turns discount on the engine production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll try to show here a few combos to let you get things done as fast and good as possible when it is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]preliminary philosophy course:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- You're not aways spiritual, but sometimes you are (or sometimes you play BtS and can switch civics for free, during a golden age or when you have christo redentor). This is good for using the best civics for a specific production.[NEWLINE]- Everything has a price. You really must be aware that you're not getting representation's free beakers when you're $rushing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Short list of combos:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- BW is a combo by itself, allowing to chop forests and to whip population. Every early rush needs this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=244075).[NEWLINE]- OrgRel when building up infra, then either pacifism or theocracy for using your infra. This can be coupled with slavery for the fastest results. Rushing a forge under orgreal to have even more bonus is kind of cool. Even better if you have gold, gems, silver to get over the happiness cost.[NEWLINE]- police state + slavery + theocracy (or vassalage) for a few cheap high level units. Overkill, if you go police state + vassalage+slavery +theocracy, but with a ger you can reach level 4 out of barracks.[NEWLINE]- bureaucracy combinations: bureau + orgrel + the right resource for a +175% hammers towards your favourite wonder. bureaucracy + police state + HE for fastest unit production ever.[NEWLINE]- nationhood + theocracy for empire wide expansion. Cheaper and faster than slavery: drafting (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=217566).[NEWLINE]- (kremlin +) universal suffrage + state property (+ caste system if you play BtS) for "production anywhere". You keep your cottages in your ancient cities, load your new cities with workshops and watermills, buy the forges, factories and stuff you need, and build the spaceship faster that you research the techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day soon, I'll move my lazy a$$ and write some details about those combos, but I'm sure you see the trick already.</French>

This is the maximum output. The further the trees are from your city, the less you hammers you get from it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chopping a forest costs 3 worker turns on normal speed. So either you send 3 workers on a tile and chop it down in 1 turn (+1 turn to move into the forest if you're not playing India with its fast workers) or send 1 worker and let it chop for 3 turns.[NEWLINE]Note that both the output of chopping and the number of worker turns needed scale with game speed.[NEWLINE]Also note that all the bonuses you have in the target city apply to the hammers from chopping.[NEWLINE]What is prechopping you've heard about? It's about applying worker turns to a forest then leaving before the forest really is chopped. This is useful for a wonder you really want: you prechop all the forests around your city, then as soon as you have the tech you need, you send a worker in and apply the final worker turn to chop. This way you can get all your forests cut down in a single turn with 1 worker/forest. Note that if you don't build a road into the forest you still lose 12 turn to move in.[NEWLINE]Prechopping can also be used to keep your workers busy while researching a worker tech in the beginning.[NEWLINE]Another thing about chopping is to chose where the hammers from a chop are going.[NEWLINE]This is rather simple. They go into the city that has the tile amongst its active tiles. This means that even you don't work the tile in your target, you should not let a different city use it if you want the hammers.[NEWLINE]If no city has the tile in its active tile, they go into the closest city. If 2 cities are equidistant, it's the oldest that gets the hammers.[NEWLINE]Beware: you can chop inside foreign cultural borders, but you won't earn the hammers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Whipping population[\BOLD] aka pop rushing:[NEWLINE]You need to be running the slavery civic, which requires bronze working. You can only whip away half the population in a given city.[NEWLINE]Although you can whip more than once in a given city in a given turn, you can only finish one item at the end of the turn.[NEWLINE]One population point is worth 30 base hammers on normal speed.[NEWLINE]This scales with game speed, and all the bonuses you have in the city apply to the whip.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for whipping before having invested hammers.[NEWLINE]There is also a penalty for whipping a wonder.[NEWLINE]There is a unhappiness penalty of 1 for 10 turns. This penalty stacks in a very painful way:[NEWLINE]If you whip twice, you get 2 unhappies for 10 turns, then you get down to 1 unhappy for 10 more turns.[NEWLINE]What can you do and what do you get? You can finish a building/unit/wonder (not a project) at the end of the turn by pushing the pop rushing button provided you run slavery and have the necessary population = twice the cost of the whip.[NEWLINE]For example, in a size 10 city, you can whip 5 population points away which is 150 base hammers worth of production, provided you spend at least 1 turn putting hammers into the build.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What would a whipper's turns look like?[NEWLINE]Turn 1 : you assign all your citizens to max food tiles, earning a few "normal" hammers (let's say 3), and start producing an item (let's say a catapult)[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you whip away 2 population points, get 60 base hammers towards the catapult + 3 from turn 1 + 3 from turn 2.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you have a catapult, and 26 hammers overflow + the 3 you're still producing. You can start anything, with 29 base hammers. If you did it right, you grew back 1 pop immediately to reach your happiness cap again immediately.[NEWLINE]turn 4 to 10: grow if possible (happiness cap!), or work max hammer tiles to prevent growth or build settlers/workers.[NEWLINE]turn 11: back to turn 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a very good article from VoiceofUnreason (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=193659) on whipping you can check, for more information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cash Rushing[\BOLD][NEWLINE]You need to run universal suffrage (available through democracy or pyramids) and to have money in the bank.[NEWLINE]You can buy units, buildings and wonders, but not projects.[NEWLINE]The price is high: 3 gold/hammer.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing without hammers invested (same as for pop rushing).[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing wonders.[NEWLINE]Bonuses don't apply.[NEWLINE]So you can buy walls for the same price, if you have stone or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What do you get? you get the item at the end of your turn, there is an overflow of exactly your base hammers.[NEWLINE]You can manage more overflow by queue juggling.[NEWLINE]An example?[NEWLINE]Let's say you have 5 honest base hammers.[NEWLINE]Turn 1: you start a forge. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you start a granary. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you start a library. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]turn 4: you start a courthouse. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 5: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the forge.[NEWLINE]turn 6: you pay (60-5)x3= 165 gold to finish the granary.[NEWLINE]turn 7: you pay (90-5)x3 = 255 gold to finish the library.[NEWLINE]turn 8: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the courthouse.[NEWLINE]turn 9: you can build what you want with (20 hammers overflow + 5 base hammers )*1,25 from the forge = 31 hammers.[NEWLINE]My example doesn't seem very impressive? Ok, I must agree.[NEWLINE]Now try it with your massive base hammers city, and get a 4 turns discount on the engine production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll try to show here a few combos to let you get things done as fast and good as possible when it is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]preliminary philosophy course:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- You're not aways spiritual, but sometimes you are (or sometimes you play BtS and can switch civics for free, during a golden age or when you have christo redentor). This is good for using the best civics for a specific production.[NEWLINE]- Everything has a price. You really must be aware that you're not getting representation's free beakers when you're $rushing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Short list of combos:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- BW is a combo by itself, allowing to chop forests and to whip population. Every early rush needs this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=244075).[NEWLINE]- OrgRel when building up infra, then either pacifism or theocracy for using your infra. This can be coupled with slavery for the fastest results. Rushing a forge under orgreal to have even more bonus is kind of cool. Even better if you have gold, gems, silver to get over the happiness cost.[NEWLINE]- police state + slavery + theocracy (or vassalage) for a few cheap high level units. Overkill, if you go police state + vassalage+slavery +theocracy, but with a ger you can reach level 4 out of barracks.[NEWLINE]- bureaucracy combinations: bureau + orgrel + the right resource for a +175% hammers towards your favourite wonder. bureaucracy + police state + HE for fastest unit production ever.[NEWLINE]- nationhood + theocracy for empire wide expansion. Cheaper and faster than slavery: drafting (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=217566).[NEWLINE]- (kremlin +) universal suffrage + state property (+ caste system if you play BtS) for "production anywhere". You keep your cottages in your ancient cities, load your new cities with workshops and watermills, buy the forges, factories and stuff you need, and build the spaceship faster that you research the techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day soon, I'll move my lazy a$$ and write some details about those combos, but I'm sure you see the trick already.</German>

This is the maximum output. The further the trees are from your city, the less you hammers you get from it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chopping a forest costs 3 worker turns on normal speed. So either you send 3 workers on a tile and chop it down in 1 turn (+1 turn to move into the forest if you're not playing India with its fast workers) or send 1 worker and let it chop for 3 turns.[NEWLINE]Note that both the output of chopping and the number of worker turns needed scale with game speed.[NEWLINE]Also note that all the bonuses you have in the target city apply to the hammers from chopping.[NEWLINE]What is prechopping you've heard about? It's about applying worker turns to a forest then leaving before the forest really is chopped. This is useful for a wonder you really want: you prechop all the forests around your city, then as soon as you have the tech you need, you send a worker in and apply the final worker turn to chop. This way you can get all your forests cut down in a single turn with 1 worker/forest. Note that if you don't build a road into the forest you still lose 12 turn to move in.[NEWLINE]Prechopping can also be used to keep your workers busy while researching a worker tech in the beginning.[NEWLINE]Another thing about chopping is to chose where the hammers from a chop are going.[NEWLINE]This is rather simple. They go into the city that has the tile amongst its active tiles. This means that even you don't work the tile in your target, you should not let a different city use it if you want the hammers.[NEWLINE]If no city has the tile in its active tile, they go into the closest city. If 2 cities are equidistant, it's the oldest that gets the hammers.[NEWLINE]Beware: you can chop inside foreign cultural borders, but you won't earn the hammers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Whipping population[\BOLD] aka pop rushing:[NEWLINE]You need to be running the slavery civic, which requires bronze working. You can only whip away half the population in a given city.[NEWLINE]Although you can whip more than once in a given city in a given turn, you can only finish one item at the end of the turn.[NEWLINE]One population point is worth 30 base hammers on normal speed.[NEWLINE]This scales with game speed, and all the bonuses you have in the city apply to the whip.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for whipping before having invested hammers.[NEWLINE]There is also a penalty for whipping a wonder.[NEWLINE]There is a unhappiness penalty of 1 for 10 turns. This penalty stacks in a very painful way:[NEWLINE]If you whip twice, you get 2 unhappies for 10 turns, then you get down to 1 unhappy for 10 more turns.[NEWLINE]What can you do and what do you get? You can finish a building/unit/wonder (not a project) at the end of the turn by pushing the pop rushing button provided you run slavery and have the necessary population = twice the cost of the whip.[NEWLINE]For example, in a size 10 city, you can whip 5 population points away which is 150 base hammers worth of production, provided you spend at least 1 turn putting hammers into the build.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What would a whipper's turns look like?[NEWLINE]Turn 1 : you assign all your citizens to max food tiles, earning a few "normal" hammers (let's say 3), and start producing an item (let's say a catapult)[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you whip away 2 population points, get 60 base hammers towards the catapult + 3 from turn 1 + 3 from turn 2.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you have a catapult, and 26 hammers overflow + the 3 you're still producing. You can start anything, with 29 base hammers. If you did it right, you grew back 1 pop immediately to reach your happiness cap again immediately.[NEWLINE]turn 4 to 10: grow if possible (happiness cap!), or work max hammer tiles to prevent growth or build settlers/workers.[NEWLINE]turn 11: back to turn 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a very good article from VoiceofUnreason (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=193659) on whipping you can check, for more information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cash Rushing[\BOLD][NEWLINE]You need to run universal suffrage (available through democracy or pyramids) and to have money in the bank.[NEWLINE]You can buy units, buildings and wonders, but not projects.[NEWLINE]The price is high: 3 gold/hammer.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing without hammers invested (same as for pop rushing).[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing wonders.[NEWLINE]Bonuses don't apply.[NEWLINE]So you can buy walls for the same price, if you have stone or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What do you get? you get the item at the end of your turn, there is an overflow of exactly your base hammers.[NEWLINE]You can manage more overflow by queue juggling.[NEWLINE]An example?[NEWLINE]Let's say you have 5 honest base hammers.[NEWLINE]Turn 1: you start a forge. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you start a granary. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you start a library. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]turn 4: you start a courthouse. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 5: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the forge.[NEWLINE]turn 6: you pay (60-5)x3= 165 gold to finish the granary.[NEWLINE]turn 7: you pay (90-5)x3 = 255 gold to finish the library.[NEWLINE]turn 8: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the courthouse.[NEWLINE]turn 9: you can build what you want with (20 hammers overflow + 5 base hammers )*1,25 from the forge = 31 hammers.[NEWLINE]My example doesn't seem very impressive? Ok, I must agree.[NEWLINE]Now try it with your massive base hammers city, and get a 4 turns discount on the engine production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll try to show here a few combos to let you get things done as fast and good as possible when it is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]preliminary philosophy course:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- You're not aways spiritual, but sometimes you are (or sometimes you play BtS and can switch civics for free, during a golden age or when you have christo redentor). This is good for using the best civics for a specific production.[NEWLINE]- Everything has a price. You really must be aware that you're not getting representation's free beakers when you're $rushing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Short list of combos:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- BW is a combo by itself, allowing to chop forests and to whip population. Every early rush needs this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=244075).[NEWLINE]- OrgRel when building up infra, then either pacifism or theocracy for using your infra. This can be coupled with slavery for the fastest results. Rushing a forge under orgreal to have even more bonus is kind of cool. Even better if you have gold, gems, silver to get over the happiness cost.[NEWLINE]- police state + slavery + theocracy (or vassalage) for a few cheap high level units. Overkill, if you go police state + vassalage+slavery +theocracy, but with a ger you can reach level 4 out of barracks.[NEWLINE]- bureaucracy combinations: bureau + orgrel + the right resource for a +175% hammers towards your favourite wonder. bureaucracy + police state + HE for fastest unit production ever.[NEWLINE]- nationhood + theocracy for empire wide expansion. Cheaper and faster than slavery: drafting (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=217566).[NEWLINE]- (kremlin +) universal suffrage + state property (+ caste system if you play BtS) for "production anywhere". You keep your cottages in your ancient cities, load your new cities with workshops and watermills, buy the forges, factories and stuff you need, and build the spaceship faster that you research the techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day soon, I'll move my lazy a$$ and write some details about those combos, but I'm sure you see the trick already.</Italian>

This is the maximum output. The further the trees are from your city, the less you hammers you get from it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chopping a forest costs 3 worker turns on normal speed. So either you send 3 workers on a tile and chop it down in 1 turn (+1 turn to move into the forest if you're not playing India with its fast workers) or send 1 worker and let it chop for 3 turns.[NEWLINE]Note that both the output of chopping and the number of worker turns needed scale with game speed.[NEWLINE]Also note that all the bonuses you have in the target city apply to the hammers from chopping.[NEWLINE]What is prechopping you've heard about? It's about applying worker turns to a forest then leaving before the forest really is chopped. This is useful for a wonder you really want: you prechop all the forests around your city, then as soon as you have the tech you need, you send a worker in and apply the final worker turn to chop. This way you can get all your forests cut down in a single turn with 1 worker/forest. Note that if you don't build a road into the forest you still lose 12 turn to move in.[NEWLINE]Prechopping can also be used to keep your workers busy while researching a worker tech in the beginning.[NEWLINE]Another thing about chopping is to chose where the hammers from a chop are going.[NEWLINE]This is rather simple. They go into the city that has the tile amongst its active tiles. This means that even you don't work the tile in your target, you should not let a different city use it if you want the hammers.[NEWLINE]If no city has the tile in its active tile, they go into the closest city. If 2 cities are equidistant, it's the oldest that gets the hammers.[NEWLINE]Beware: you can chop inside foreign cultural borders, but you won't earn the hammers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Whipping population[\BOLD] aka pop rushing:[NEWLINE]You need to be running the slavery civic, which requires bronze working. You can only whip away half the population in a given city.[NEWLINE]Although you can whip more than once in a given city in a given turn, you can only finish one item at the end of the turn.[NEWLINE]One population point is worth 30 base hammers on normal speed.[NEWLINE]This scales with game speed, and all the bonuses you have in the city apply to the whip.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for whipping before having invested hammers.[NEWLINE]There is also a penalty for whipping a wonder.[NEWLINE]There is a unhappiness penalty of 1 for 10 turns. This penalty stacks in a very painful way:[NEWLINE]If you whip twice, you get 2 unhappies for 10 turns, then you get down to 1 unhappy for 10 more turns.[NEWLINE]What can you do and what do you get? You can finish a building/unit/wonder (not a project) at the end of the turn by pushing the pop rushing button provided you run slavery and have the necessary population = twice the cost of the whip.[NEWLINE]For example, in a size 10 city, you can whip 5 population points away which is 150 base hammers worth of production, provided you spend at least 1 turn putting hammers into the build.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What would a whipper's turns look like?[NEWLINE]Turn 1 : you assign all your citizens to max food tiles, earning a few "normal" hammers (let's say 3), and start producing an item (let's say a catapult)[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you whip away 2 population points, get 60 base hammers towards the catapult + 3 from turn 1 + 3 from turn 2.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you have a catapult, and 26 hammers overflow + the 3 you're still producing. You can start anything, with 29 base hammers. If you did it right, you grew back 1 pop immediately to reach your happiness cap again immediately.[NEWLINE]turn 4 to 10: grow if possible (happiness cap!), or work max hammer tiles to prevent growth or build settlers/workers.[NEWLINE]turn 11: back to turn 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a very good article from VoiceofUnreason (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=193659) on whipping you can check, for more information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cash Rushing[\BOLD][NEWLINE]You need to run universal suffrage (available through democracy or pyramids) and to have money in the bank.[NEWLINE]You can buy units, buildings and wonders, but not projects.[NEWLINE]The price is high: 3 gold/hammer.[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing without hammers invested (same as for pop rushing).[NEWLINE]There is a penalty for rushing wonders.[NEWLINE]Bonuses don't apply.[NEWLINE]So you can buy walls for the same price, if you have stone or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What do you get? you get the item at the end of your turn, there is an overflow of exactly your base hammers.[NEWLINE]You can manage more overflow by queue juggling.[NEWLINE]An example?[NEWLINE]Let's say you have 5 honest base hammers.[NEWLINE]Turn 1: you start a forge. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 2: you start a granary. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 3: you start a library. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]turn 4: you start a courthouse. 5 hammers go into it.[NEWLINE]Turn 5: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the forge.[NEWLINE]turn 6: you pay (60-5)x3= 165 gold to finish the granary.[NEWLINE]turn 7: you pay (90-5)x3 = 255 gold to finish the library.[NEWLINE]turn 8: you pay (120-5)x3 = 345 gold to finish the courthouse.[NEWLINE]turn 9: you can build what you want with (20 hammers overflow + 5 base hammers )*1,25 from the forge = 31 hammers.[NEWLINE]My example doesn't seem very impressive? Ok, I must agree.[NEWLINE]Now try it with your massive base hammers city, and get a 4 turns discount on the engine production.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I'll try to show here a few combos to let you get things done as fast and good as possible when it is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]preliminary philosophy course:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- You're not aways spiritual, but sometimes you are (or sometimes you play BtS and can switch civics for free, during a golden age or when you have christo redentor). This is good for using the best civics for a specific production.[NEWLINE]- Everything has a price. You really must be aware that you're not getting representation's free beakers when you're $rushing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Short list of combos:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]- BW is a combo by itself, allowing to chop forests and to whip population. Every early rush needs this (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=244075).[NEWLINE]- OrgRel when building up infra, then either pacifism or theocracy for using your infra. This can be coupled with slavery for the fastest results. Rushing a forge under orgreal to have even more bonus is kind of cool. Even better if you have gold, gems, silver to get over the happiness cost.[NEWLINE]- police state + slavery + theocracy (or vassalage) for a few cheap high level units. Overkill, if you go police state + vassalage+slavery +theocracy, but with a ger you can reach level 4 out of barracks.[NEWLINE]- bureaucracy combinations: bureau + orgrel + the right resource for a +175% hammers towards your favourite wonder. bureaucracy + police state + HE for fastest unit production ever.[NEWLINE]- nationhood + theocracy for empire wide expansion. Cheaper and faster than slavery: drafting (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=217566).[NEWLINE]- (kremlin +) universal suffrage + state property (+ caste system if you play BtS) for "production anywhere". You keep your cottages in your ancient cities, load your new cities with workshops and watermills, buy the forges, factories and stuff you need, and build the spaceship faster that you research the techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day soon, I'll move my lazy a$$ and write some details about those combos, but I'm sure you see the trick already.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Unit Maintenance Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Roland Johansen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I didn't see an article covering the unit maintenance and did see a few questions about this subject, I thought about researching it myself. I hope it will be useful to some people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first section of this article is about the in-game information of unit costs and how to read it correctly. The second part is about how the unit costs are calculated in Civ 4. In the third part some strategic consequences of the way Civ4 calculates unit maintenance are considered. The fourth part considers some of the differences for unit maintenance between the human and the AI. A fifth part contains some information for modders that want to change the way the game calculates the free unit support or want to change the basic costs of units whether they are inside or outside of your borders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How to read the in-game information[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unit maintenance is divided in two sections, unit costs and unit supply. Both of these costs are mentioned in the financial adviser (F2). You can mouse over these sections and get some additional information.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The unit cost section has the following mouse over information (the numbers are just an example):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]10: Unit cost for 10 units (free support for 14)[NEWLINE]15: Military unit cost for 15 units (free support for 3)[NEWLINE]-13: handicap cost[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first line means that your empire has 24 units. You only have to pay maintenance for 10 of them as you have a free support of 14 units. The second line shows that your empire has 18 military units (every unit except settlers, workers and missionaries). You only have to pay maintenance for 15 of them as you have a free support of 3 units. This military unit cost is usually 0 and will only have a positive number when you're running the pacifism civic. The last line is a discount and is dependent on the difficulty level of the game (it is 0 for deity level).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The unit supply section has the following mouse over information (again the numbers are just an example):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3: away supply for 7 units (free support for 4)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This means that your empire has 11 units outside its cultural borders. You only have to pay supply costs for 7 of them as you have a free supply support for 4 units. These 7 units have a supply cost of 7/2=3 rounded down. Note that also non-military units like settlers, workers and missionaries have supply costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How does the game calculate the free unit support and the handicap cost?[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some of you might have noticed that the amount of free support increases as you play the game. This is true for the free support in the unit cost section, but not the free support in the unit supply section. The free support in the unit supply section is always 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, the free support in the unit cost section is dependent on the total size of your population (the sum of all of your city sizes) and the difficulty level. If we name the size of your population N and the difficulty level bonus D then the free support for units is [0.24 * N] + D. This difficulty level bonus is 5 at Deity, 6 at Immortal, 7 at Emperor, 8 at Monarch, 10 at Prince, 12 at Noble, 16 at Warlord, 22 at Chieftain and finally 28 at Settler level.[NEWLINE]The vassalage civic provides you with an additional free unit support which is again dependent on your population size: [0.1 * N] + 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free support in the military unit section is also dependent on the size of your population: [0.12 * N] + 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All of these numbers are rounded down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The handicap cost is a percentage of the total unit cost (unit cost + military unit cost) which is dependent on the difficulty level. The percentage is 0 at Deity, 10 at Immortal, 20 at Emperor, 30 at Monarch, 40 at Prince, 50 at Noble, 60 at Warlord, 70 at Chieftain and finally 80 at Settler level. This number is rounded up.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]10: Unit cost for 10 units (free support for 14)[NEWLINE]15: Military unit cost for 15 units (free support for 3)[NEWLINE]-13: handicap cost[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are the unit costs from an empire with a size 5, 3 and 2 city. So the total population size is 10. It is a game at Noble difficulty level, so the difficulty level bonus is 12. In this game the vassalage civic that grants additional free support is not used. So the free support is 0.24 * 10 + 12 = 14 (rounded down).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this game, the pacifism civic is used and we thus have to pay military unit costs. The free support is 0.12 * 10 + 2 = 3 (rounded down).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As this is a game at Noble difficulty level, the handicap costs are 50% of 25 = 13 (rounded up).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Strategic Consequences[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The unit cost limits fast expansion.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free unit support can take a large chunk out of your unit maintenance cost and should thus be maximized. There is only one real way to do that and that is to increase your population before you create a lot of units. To support all the units needed for a fast expansion a large population size is needed, but that is against the nature of fast expansion. If you neglect you defenses in order to save yourself from high unit maintenance costs, then you risk your cities being taken over by barbarians or your settlers eaten by lions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Early exploration/attack with many units is very expensive.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free support cost for unit supply is only 4. This means that if 6 or more units are not within your cultural borders (including workers, settlers and missionaries), then you will start to pay unit supply costs for those units. As money is scarce in the beginning of the game, this upkeep can be too much.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]An empire with large cities can easily support a sizable army without any unit maintenance cost.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a rule of thumb, you can say that 4 units of population supply 1 unit for free (not exact, but close enough). So if your cities are size 8 on average, then each city can support 2 units free of charge. If your cities are size 16 on average then each city can support 4 units free of charge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This doesn't mean that building farms to grow big cities is the way to go as there are other terrain improvements that are often worth more. It does mean that building many small cities close to each other is not as smart as a few larger cities, because the larger cities can be better defended or can supply an additional offensive army next to its own defensive units. (You also don't want to have many small cities because of high city maintenance.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination with the article on civic upkeep, one can see that the additional free unit support from the vassalage civic is less than the upkeep cost of this civic (except for very small empires). (The vassalage civic gives 0.1 N + 5 extra free unit support, but it costs more than 0.15 N as a civic.) This doesn't make the civic useless as it also offers 2 experience to all units that are trained, but it is something to consider when choosing this civic. If your leader is organized, then the civic upkeep costs are halved and the additional free unit support offered by the vassalage civic is actually comparable to its upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Different unit maintenance cost between the human and the AI[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The AI pays a different unit upkeep as the human player. It pays the same as a human with a similar empire would pay at noble level if you play the game at settler, chieftain, warlord or noble difficulty level. It pays 95% at prince level, 90% at monarch level, 85% at emperor level, 80% at immortal level and only 60% at deity level (all compared to a human player with a similar empire at noble difficulty level).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The human player pays 50% extra for units outside of its borders (see first section on unit supply). However, the AI only pays a percentage of this cost that is again dependent on difficulty level: 50% at settler, 45% at chieftain, 40% at warlord, 35% at noble, 30% at prince, 25% at monarch, 20% at emperor, 15% at immortal and finally 10% at deity level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are more differences between the AI and the humans at the various difficulty levels, but these are the only ones that have to do with this article. An important discount for the AI that is somewhat related to this article is the AI discount on unit upgrade costs. The AI pays much less for upgrading units at every difficulty level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some information for modders[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I found the XML files that determine the free unit support and it might be interesting for some modders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The modifiers that determine the amount of free support and the maintenance cost of units (inside or outside of your borders) can be found in the file GlobalDefines.xml and are named:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]INITIAL_BASE_FREE_UNITS, INITIAL_BASE_FREE_MILITARY_UNITS, INITIAL_FREE_UNITS_POPULATION_PERCENT, INITIAL_FREE_MILITARY_UNITS_POPULATION_PERCENT, INITIAL_GOLD_PER_UNIT, INITIAL_FREE_OUTSIDE_UNITS, INITIAL_OUTSIDE_UNIT_GOLD_PERCENT[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I think that the names of these modifiers speak for themselves if combined with the formulas for free unit support above.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the civic Vassalage, the modifiers that determine free unit support can be found in the file CIV4CivicInfos.xml and are named iBaseFreeUnits and iFreeUnitsPopulationPercent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty modifier that adds to the free unit support is of course found in the file Civ4HandicapInfo.xml and is named iFreeUnits. The modifier that determines the handicap cost is also in this file and is named iUnitCostPercent. Note that this modifier denotes the amount that you actually pay and not the amount of cost reduction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that the basic number of free units named D in the formula above is the number denoted behind iFreeUnits in the file Civ4HandicapInfo.xml added to the number denoted behind INITIAL_BASE_FREE_UNITS in the file GlobalDefines.xml.</English>

Note that also non-military units like settlers, workers and missionaries have supply costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How does the game calculate the free unit support and the handicap cost?[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some of you might have noticed that the amount of free support increases as you play the game. This is true for the free support in the unit cost section, but not the free support in the unit supply section. The free support in the unit supply section is always 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, the free support in the unit cost section is dependent on the total size of your population (the sum of all of your city sizes) and the difficulty level. If we name the size of your population N and the difficulty level bonus D then the free support for units is [0.24 * N] + D. This difficulty level bonus is 5 at Deity, 6 at Immortal, 7 at Emperor, 8 at Monarch, 10 at Prince, 12 at Noble, 16 at Warlord, 22 at Chieftain and finally 28 at Settler level.[NEWLINE]The vassalage civic provides you with an additional free unit support which is again dependent on your population size: [0.1 * N] + 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free support in the military unit section is also dependent on the size of your population: [0.12 * N] + 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All of these numbers are rounded down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The handicap cost is a percentage of the total unit cost (unit cost + military unit cost) which is dependent on the difficulty level. The percentage is 0 at Deity, 10 at Immortal, 20 at Emperor, 30 at Monarch, 40 at Prince, 50 at Noble, 60 at Warlord, 70 at Chieftain and finally 80 at Settler level. This number is rounded up.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]10: Unit cost for 10 units (free support for 14)[NEWLINE]15: Military unit cost for 15 units (free support for 3)[NEWLINE]-13: handicap cost[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are the unit costs from an empire with a size 5, 3 and 2 city. So the total population size is 10. It is a game at Noble difficulty level, so the difficulty level bonus is 12. In this game the vassalage civic that grants additional free support is not used. So the free support is 0.24 * 10 + 12 = 14 (rounded down).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this game, the pacifism civic is used and we thus have to pay military unit costs. The free support is 0.12 * 10 + 2 = 3 (rounded down).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As this is a game at Noble difficulty level, the handicap costs are 50% of 25 = 13 (rounded up).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Strategic Consequences[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The unit cost limits fast expansion.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free unit support can take a large chunk out of your unit maintenance cost and should thus be maximized. There is only one real way to do that and that is to increase your population before you create a lot of units. To support all the units needed for a fast expansion a large population size is needed, but that is against the nature of fast expansion. If you neglect you defenses in order to save yourself from high unit maintenance costs, then you risk your cities being taken over by barbarians or your settlers eaten by lions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Early exploration/attack with many units is very expensive.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free support cost for unit supply is only 4. This means that if 6 or more units are not within your cultural borders (including workers, settlers and missionaries), then you will start to pay unit supply costs for those units. As money is scarce in the beginning of the game, this upkeep can be too much.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]An empire with large cities can easily support a sizable army without any unit maintenance cost.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a rule of thumb, you can say that 4 units of population supply 1 unit for free (not exact, but close enough). So if your cities are size 8 on average, then each city can support 2 units free of charge. If your cities are size 16 on average then each city can support 4 units free of charge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This doesn't mean that building farms to grow big cities is the way to go as there are other terrain improvements that are often worth more. It does mean that building many small cities close to each other is not as smart as a few larger cities, because the larger cities can be better defended or can supply an additional offensive army next to its own defensive units. (You also don't want to have many small cities because of high city maintenance.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination with the article on civic upkeep, one can see that the additional free unit support from the vassalage civic is less than the upkeep cost of this civic (except for very small empires). (The vassalage civic gives 0.1 N + 5 extra free unit support, but it costs more than 0.15 N as a civic.) This doesn't make the civic useless as it also offers 2 experience to all units that are trained, but it is something to consider when choosing this civic. If your leader is organized, then the civic upkeep costs are halved and the additional free unit support offered by the vassalage civic is actually comparable to its upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Different unit maintenance cost between the human and the AI[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The AI pays a different unit upkeep as the human player. It pays the same as a human with a similar empire would pay at noble level if you play the game at settler, chieftain, warlord or noble difficulty level. It pays 95% at prince level, 90% at monarch level, 85% at emperor level, 80% at immortal level and only 60% at deity level (all compared to a human player with a similar empire at noble difficulty level).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The human player pays 50% extra for units outside of its borders (see first section on unit supply). However, the AI only pays a percentage of this cost that is again dependent on difficulty level: 50% at settler, 45% at chieftain, 40% at warlord, 35% at noble, 30% at prince, 25% at monarch, 20% at emperor, 15% at immortal and finally 10% at deity level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are more differences between the AI and the humans at the various difficulty levels, but these are the only ones that have to do with this article. An important discount for the AI that is somewhat related to this article is the AI discount on unit upgrade costs. The AI pays much less for upgrading units at every difficulty level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some information for modders[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I found the XML files that determine the free unit support and it might be interesting for some modders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The modifiers that determine the amount of free support and the maintenance cost of units (inside or outside of your borders) can be found in the file GlobalDefines.xml and are named:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]INITIAL_BASE_FREE_UNITS, INITIAL_BASE_FREE_MILITARY_UNITS, INITIAL_FREE_UNITS_POPULATION_PERCENT, INITIAL_FREE_MILITARY_UNITS_POPULATION_PERCENT, INITIAL_GOLD_PER_UNIT, INITIAL_FREE_OUTSIDE_UNITS, INITIAL_OUTSIDE_UNIT_GOLD_PERCENT[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I think that the names of these modifiers speak for themselves if combined with the formulas for free unit support above.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the civic Vassalage, the modifiers that determine free unit support can be found in the file CIV4CivicInfos.xml and are named iBaseFreeUnits and iFreeUnitsPopulationPercent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty modifier that adds to the free unit support is of course found in the file Civ4HandicapInfo.xml and is named iFreeUnits. The modifier that determines the handicap cost is also in this file and is named iUnitCostPercent. Note that this modifier denotes the amount that you actually pay and not the amount of cost reduction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that the basic number of free units named D in the formula above is the number denoted behind iFreeUnits in the file Civ4HandicapInfo.xml added to the number denoted behind INITIAL_BASE_FREE_UNITS in the file GlobalDefines.xml.</German>

		<English>[H1]City Growth[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Tigger70[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have been inquiring into the system of city growth in civ IV. Sufficient results have been obtained to warrant posting and discussion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A note about our topic: the fundamental dynamic at work in civ is the acquisition of rights to work game tiles. Aside from the food management issue, working such tiles yields commerce points and hammer points, and on this all else depends. Hammers are developed into units and resource multipliers (buildings); commerce generates trading options with other AI civs and, most obviously, beakers for the acquisition of techs. Managing the rate at which new tiles can be acquired is accordingly central to strategic play. This suffices as a defense regarding the significance of the topic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will proceed to list the findings of interest point-by-point. All numerical values are applicable for the correct game speed (epic speed). I have not inquired into how the system works at other speeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](1) Growth Requirements[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A city of size 1 requires acquisition of 33F to grow to size 2. A city of size 2 requires 36F, size 3 39F, size 4 42F, and so forth (temporarily setting aside the effects of a granary). So far as I can determine this system of +3 storage required per size &gt; 1 continues indefinitely. A size 20 city requires 90F stored to grow to size 21, which is in accordance with the basic pattern. The core point to note here is that there exists no "cut-off" point beyond which further growth becomes abnormally more difficult than it was before (I mean this with respect to storage requirements only. Obviously the availability of health, happiness, and so forth can present interacting factors that make further growth not possible).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](2) Food surpluses wrap after growth[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When scanning over the food bar in the city screen we might see a value of something like 42/48. What this means is that 42F surplus has been stored, with 48 required for the current growth cycle to complete. Suppose that we have a 10F surplus at this time. The city will grow at the conclusion of the present turn. On the next turn the city will show 4/51 - meaning that the extra 4F not needed for the cycle has "wrapped" over into the next cycle. This alleviates the potential need for obnoxious micro-management. Without it we would want to remove citizens from food-tiles towards the end of a cycle so as to avoid accumulating resources that will be lost. Fortunately matters do not work this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](3) Granaries, Part 1[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The granary stores 50% of the needed food in one cycle for use in the next. What this would mean in our previous example is that when the 42/48 city grows, the food bar will show 28F on the next subsequent turn. 50% of 48 = 24, plus the extra 4F which "wraps" after growth = 28F total. If we were running a food surplus of 6F in that example (thus matching the needed amount exactly), 24F would appear on the immediate following turn via the granary effect alone. Note that the next cycle would require 51F for growth, so we would see 24/51 on the next cycle. This is slightly less than 50% of what is required for the next growth increase. In practice the difference is negligible, but it is noteworthy for understanding how the system works.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](4) Population and whipping (slavery civic)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The program straightforwardly eliminates X population when whipping without doing anything else. What I mean by this: suppose we have a size 6 city with 26/48 in the food bar and we whip 2 citizens. After whipping we will show size 4, 26/42. The 26F present before the whipping operation remains. This produces outcomes that can appear weird in certain situations when not paying attention. Suppose we have a size 6 city with 46/48 and we whip two citizens. After the whipping operation we will have 46/42 with growth in 1 turn. On the next turn the city is size 5 and it appears that we whipped only 1 citizen. If we had NOT whipped the citizens, the city would have grown to size 7 on the relevant turn (assuming at least 2 food surplus). Since we DID whip the citizens, the city is size 5 on the following turn -a difference of 2 citizens, as advertised. It is a matter of understanding that only the population has been eliminated, not the stored F-values that have been accumulated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](5) Calculating the food surplus[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose we have a size 3 city working tiles (1) a farmed flood plain, (2) a mined grassland hill, and (3) another mined grassland hill. Each citizen requires 2F support. The farmed flood plain provides 4F, the mined hills 1 F a piece - yielding 6F total. Since we have 3 citizens needing 2F each, we have met the requirements and it would appear that the city should be stagnant. But it isn't. A related way of thinking about these tiles holds that the flood plain is "supporting" the mines squares. This way of thinking has its uses but it misses the point. Regarding the first observation: the city is effectively given a "0-citizen" tile to work. This is the city's base (home) tile - usually 2F 1P 1C. This "free" tiles gives a +2 food surplus if all the other tiles come out even (with respect to surplus). The above calculation is skipping the base city square - the city will have a +2F surplus because of the "free" tile. Regarding the"way of thinking" mentioned above: The art of city food maintenance is the art of managing the rate at which new tiles can be worked. This is directly tied to the city's food surplus at any given time, which in turn is the only value that matters. It is true that tiles (1), (2), and (3) will be neutral with respect to food surplus. In this sense the flood plain is "supporting" the mined squares. We don't want to manage city growth though via the roundabout method of balancing which squares are "supporting" others. Doing so constitutes a mistake in understanding what the fundamental driving factor is in managing city growth: the food surplus value, which determines the rate at which new tiles can be worked over time The two points to note here are (1) the effect of the free "0-citizen" tile in calculating the food surplus value (it usually adds +2) and (2) understanding that the core value which matters is the food-surplus number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](6) City-Growth Table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At certain stages in the game we review our cities while they are in various stages of their growth cycles. When they are midway or further in a growth cycle, changing worked tiles (and thus the food-surplus value) changes the number of turns remaining in the cycle by a considerable factor - often by 3-5 turns. City growth management however is ultimately a long-term project. We are interested in managing the number of turns required to move from size 5 to size 10, 15, and beyond. To understand the factors involved in this long-term project, we need to understand the cumulative effect of average food-surplus values over an extended period of time. The following chart is a tool I have put together for this purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]1[TAB][TAB]2[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4[TAB][TAB]5[NEWLINE]1[TAB]33[TAB][TAB]36/20[TAB][TAB]39/21[TAB][TAB]42/23[TAB][TAB]45/24[NEWLINE]2[TAB]17[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[TAB][TAB]21/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[NEWLINE]3[TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]4[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[NEWLINE]5[TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]6[TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]7[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]8[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]9[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]10[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]11[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8[TAB][TAB]9[TAB][TAB]10[NEWLINE]1[TAB]48/26[TAB][TAB]51/27[TAB][TAB]54/29[TAB][TAB]57/30[TAB][TAB]60/32[NEWLINE]2[TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]26/14[TAB][TAB]27/15[TAB][TAB]29/15[TAB][TAB]30/16[NEWLINE]3[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[NEWLINE]4[TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]5[TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]6[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[NEWLINE]7[TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]8[TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]9[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]10[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12[TAB][TAB]13[TAB][TAB]14[TAB][TAB]15[NEWLINE]1[TAB]63/33[TAB][TAB]66/35[TAB][TAB]69/36[TAB][TAB]72/38[TAB][TAB]75/39[NEWLINE]2[TAB]32/17[TAB][TAB]33/18[TAB][TAB]35/18[TAB][TAB]36/19[TAB][TAB]38/20[NEWLINE]3[TAB]21/11[TAB][TAB]22/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[TAB][TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]25/13[NEWLINE]4[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[NEWLINE]5[TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]6[TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]7[TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[NEWLINE]8[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[NEWLINE]9[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]10[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]12[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rows are food-surplus values, while the columns indicate current city size. Each cell consists of two numbers. The first number gives the number of turns required for city growth if the city does not have a granary. The second number provides the number of turns required if the city does have a granary (and it was functional during the previous growth cycle). The table does not take into account the food-wrap issue discussed above. What this means is that sometimes we will save a turn from the provided number. For example suppose we are running a 10 -surplus city at size 4. 42F is required to advance. On the 5th turn the city will grow, resulting in 8/45 at the start of the next cycle. With 8 food stored, we will need 4 turns to reach 48/45 and thus to grow again. The chart however indicates 5 turns (not 4) since that is the number of turns that would be required if we had zero food at the start of the relevant cycle. Note what happens here though. We will move from 48/45 to 3/48 at size 6. Here 5 turns will be required, as indicated in the chart. In short, the food-wrapping effect intermittently permits us to save one turn. In the long-term however the number of saved turns is largely the same regardless of which row (and thus which average food-surplus is being used). This permits us to ignore the effect for relative comparisons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](7) Observations from the City-Growth table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The key feature to note from the table is the significance of running a 5-food surplus (with a granary) or a 6-food surplus (without a granary). Running a surplus of 4 or less comes with a very significant cost in long-term growth. Running a surplus higher than 5 or 6 does bring distinct advantages. These advantages however are considerably more incremental in character than they are at the lower values. Beyond a food-surplus value of around 6, working a zero-food citizen (mined plains tile, specialist, etc.) is considerably more palatable than it is at lower surplus values [note: the decision to work a zero-food citizen is significant since the cost of doing so lowers the food-surplus value by 2, as opposed to lowering only by 1 working a mined grassland hills or maintaining the current surplus by working a grassland pot (cottage)].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some quick observations to help make this point. Suppose that we are growing a size 3 city to size 4. Without a granary, this requires 14 turns with a 3F surplus. It requires only 7 turns with a 6F surplus, accomplishing the task 50% faster. A second case: suppose we are growing a city from size 3 to size 6 (without a granary). Using a 3F surplus requires 42 turns; using a 5F surplus requires 26 turns. Again, the difference is remarkable. On the other hand: we grow from size 3 to size 4 in 7 turns using a 6F surplus. If we increase our surplus to 9F, the task will be accomplished in 5 turns instead of 7. Switching from a 3F- surplus to 6F saves 7 turns. Switching from 6F to 9F saves only 2 turns. Without a granary, a 6-F surplus is the maximally efficient number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will leave other observations to those who see them. The quick point to note is the significance of the window between the 5F and 6F surplus numbers. Running a surplus 4 or lower for any significant amount of time will yield poor and sub-optimal returns. The 5F to 6F window is entirely satisfactory and maximally efficient. Running a surplus beyond 6F will yield accelerated development, but with a lowered incremental rate of return. Beyond 6F the prospect of utilizing a zero-food citizen becomes notably more reasonable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](8) Obvious caveats[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I mention this to ward off needing to say it at some future time. There are obviously going to be situations in which other game factors are more important than managing city growth. In the window before calendar/hereditary rule, we are often running with a happiness limitation to growth. In these circumstances running a surplus of 4 or lower is entirely reasonable. If we're in a military conflict, running with sub-optimal growth parameters may be advantageous and/or necessary. In addition, when making a run for a world-wonder, emphasizing hammers in exchange for growth can obviously be correct. The larger issue of balancing the various intersecting factors in the game isn't the point of issue. We are isolating one segment of game-play to see what can be discovered about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](9) Granaries, Part II[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The long-term cumulative effect of granaries is quite striking. Suppose we are growing a city from size 5 to size 15 with a steady 5F food surplus. Without a granary the process will take 121 turns. With a granary the process will take 66 turns. The city without the granary requires 55(!) more turns to complete the process. This constitutes a steady delay in acquiring new tile resources, which in turn drives all other aspects of play. The default plan for any normal city accordingly must include building a granary at some point or another. The issue of when to build it is open to context, and of course there will be exceptions for cities that are geographically placed in growth-limited locations, or are peculiar in some other such way. For any normal city though, there must be some feature in the larger strategic context that overrides the default plan to make skipping the granary completely a reasonably correct decision.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](10) The State Property civic[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose that we are in the later stages of developing some particular city. We have a 3F surplus, and we intend to "complete" the city by growing onto 3 plains tiles with 1F a piece. When this is done the city will be completed in its capacity to work the maximal number of tiles it can, and will accordingly be stagnated. Growth may start up again way later when we obtain the biology tech, but we can assume this will be a long time in coming. The obvious problem which we face here is that growing onto the last tiles will take an extremely large number of turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 3F surplus is bad enough (especially when we are likely dealing with a reasonably large city already, with extended food storage requirements). Matters will only get worse though when the first cycle is completed, leaving a 2F surplus followed by the snails-pace that will arrive for the last tile with a 1F surplus. Reasonably speaking, growing onto the last tiles will take such a long time that we are largely foregoing their use. The State Property civic appears designed to assist with this. The civic is quite popular for the maintenance bonus it gives (no distance-from-palace maintenance) but it's effect on city growth strategy appears to be overlooked. In many cases we will want to build windmills on plains-hills tiles and watermills on plains-river tiles. Doing so makes both of them interchangeable at 1F 2P 1C, and they will improve later: +1P with replaceable parts and +2 commerce with electricity. The State Property civic gives a +1F bonus for windmills/watermills. What this means is that if/when we employ State Property, either as a long-term civic or as a temporary 15-20 turn choice, we will very often be able to complete cities that would otherwise take an inordinate number of turns. In the above example, suppose we have 4 windmills/watermills being worked in that city. When we adopt state property our food surplus will increase by 4F. In the process of growing onto the last 3 intended tiles, we will move from 7F to 6F to 5F in surpluses rather than from 3F to 2F to 1F. The result is that the city can grow onto those last tiles in an entirely reasonable number of turns. If/when we change out of state property[NEWLINE]afterwards our food surplus will disappear and the city will be stagnant, but working the tiles that were planned for its employ. This is often the only feasible way to enable tile utilization in the late stages of city growth - unless we want to wait for Biology (which is typically an unacceptable delay).</English>
		<French>[H1]City Growth[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Tigger70[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have been inquiring into the system of city growth in civ IV. Sufficient results have been obtained to warrant posting and discussion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A note about our topic: the fundamental dynamic at work in civ is the acquisition of rights to work game tiles. Aside from the food management issue, working such tiles yields commerce points and hammer points, and on this all else depends. Hammers are developed into units and resource multipliers (buildings); commerce generates trading options with other AI civs and, most obviously, beakers for the acquisition of techs. Managing the rate at which new tiles can be acquired is accordingly central to strategic play. This suffices as a defense regarding the significance of the topic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will proceed to list the findings of interest point-by-point. All numerical values are applicable for the correct game speed (epic speed). I have not inquired into how the system works at other speeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](1) Growth Requirements[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A city of size 1 requires acquisition of 33F to grow to size 2. A city of size 2 requires 36F, size 3 39F, size 4 42F, and so forth (temporarily setting aside the effects of a granary). So far as I can determine this system of +3 storage required per size &gt; 1 continues indefinitely. A size 20 city requires 90F stored to grow to size 21, which is in accordance with the basic pattern. The core point to note here is that there exists no "cut-off" point beyond which further growth becomes abnormally more difficult than it was before (I mean this with respect to storage requirements only. Obviously the availability of health, happiness, and so forth can present interacting factors that make further growth not possible).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](2) Food surpluses wrap after growth[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When scanning over the food bar in the city screen we might see a value of something like 42/48. What this means is that 42F surplus has been stored, with 48 required for the current growth cycle to complete. Suppose that we have a 10F surplus at this time. The city will grow at the conclusion of the present turn. On the next turn the city will show 4/51 - meaning that the extra 4F not needed for the cycle has "wrapped" over into the next cycle. This alleviates the potential need for obnoxious micro-management. Without it we would want to remove citizens from food-tiles towards the end of a cycle so as to avoid accumulating resources that will be lost. Fortunately matters do not work this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](3) Granaries, Part 1[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The granary stores 50% of the needed food in one cycle for use in the next. What this would mean in our previous example is that when the 42/48 city grows, the food bar will show 28F on the next subsequent turn. 50% of 48 = 24, plus the extra 4F which "wraps" after growth = 28F total. If we were running a food surplus of 6F in that example (thus matching the needed amount exactly), 24F would appear on the immediate following turn via the granary effect alone. Note that the next cycle would require 51F for growth, so we would see 24/51 on the next cycle. This is slightly less than 50% of what is required for the next growth increase. In practice the difference is negligible, but it is noteworthy for understanding how the system works.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](4) Population and whipping (slavery civic)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The program straightforwardly eliminates X population when whipping without doing anything else. What I mean by this: suppose we have a size 6 city with 26/48 in the food bar and we whip 2 citizens. After whipping we will show size 4, 26/42. The 26F present before the whipping operation remains. This produces outcomes that can appear weird in certain situations when not paying attention. Suppose we have a size 6 city with 46/48 and we whip two citizens. After the whipping operation we will have 46/42 with growth in 1 turn. On the next turn the city is size 5 and it appears that we whipped only 1 citizen. If we had NOT whipped the citizens, the city would have grown to size 7 on the relevant turn (assuming at least 2 food surplus). Since we DID whip the citizens, the city is size 5 on the following turn -a difference of 2 citizens, as advertised. It is a matter of understanding that only the population has been eliminated, not the stored F-values that have been accumulated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](5) Calculating the food surplus[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose we have a size 3 city working tiles (1) a farmed flood plain, (2) a mined grassland hill, and (3) another mined grassland hill.

City growth management however is ultimately a long-term project. We are interested in managing the number of turns required to move from size 5 to size 10, 15, and beyond. To understand the factors involved in this long-term project, we need to understand the cumulative effect of average food-surplus values over an extended period of time.

Each cell consists of two numbers. The first number gives the number of turns required for city growth if the city does not have a granary. The second number provides the number of turns required if the city does have a granary (and it was functional during the previous growth cycle). The table does not take into account the food-wrap issue discussed above. What this means is that sometimes we will save a turn from the provided number. For example suppose we are running a 10 -surplus city at size 4. 42F is required to advance. On the 5th turn the city will grow, resulting in 8/45 at the start of the next cycle. With 8 food stored, we will need 4 turns to reach 48/45 and thus to grow again. The chart however indicates 5 turns (not 4) since that is the number of turns that would be required if we had zero food at the start of the relevant cycle. Note what happens here though. We will move from 48/45 to 3/48 at size 6. Here 5 turns will be required, as indicated in the chart. In short, the food-wrapping effect intermittently permits us to save one turn. In the long-term however the number of saved turns is largely the same regardless of which row (and thus which average food-surplus is being used). This permits us to ignore the effect for relative comparisons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](7) Observations from the City-Growth table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The key feature to note from the table is the significance of running a 5-food surplus (with a granary) or a 6-food surplus (without a granary). Running a surplus of 4 or less comes with a very significant cost in long-term growth. Running a surplus higher than 5 or 6 does bring distinct advantages. These advantages however are considerably more incremental in character than they are at the lower values. Beyond a food-surplus value of around 6, working a zero-food citizen (mined plains tile, specialist, etc.) is considerably more palatable than it is at lower surplus values [note: the decision to work a zero-food citizen is significant since the cost of doing so lowers the food-surplus value by 2, as opposed to lowering only by 1 working a mined grassland hills or maintaining the current surplus by working a grassland pot (cottage)].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some quick observations to help make this point. Suppose that we are growing a size 3 city to size 4. Without a granary, this requires 14 turns with a 3F surplus. It requires only 7 turns with a 6F surplus, accomplishing the task 50% faster. A second case: suppose we are growing a city from size 3 to size 6 (without a granary). Using a 3F surplus requires 42 turns; using a 5F surplus requires 26 turns. Again, the difference is remarkable. On the other hand: we grow from size 3 to size 4 in 7 turns using a 6F surplus. If we increase our surplus to 9F, the task will be accomplished in 5 turns instead of 7. Switching from a 3F- surplus to 6F saves 7 turns. Switching from 6F to 9F saves only 2 turns. Without a granary, a 6-F surplus is the maximally efficient number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will leave other observations to those who see them. The quick point to note is the significance of the window between the 5F and 6F surplus numbers. Running a surplus 4 or lower for any significant amount of time will yield poor and sub-optimal returns. The 5F to 6F window is entirely satisfactory and maximally efficient. Running a surplus beyond 6F will yield accelerated development, but with a lowered incremental rate of return. Beyond 6F the prospect of utilizing a zero-food citizen becomes notably more reasonable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](8) Obvious caveats[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I mention this to ward off needing to say it at some future time. There are obviously going to be situations in which other game factors are more important than managing city growth. In the window before calendar/hereditary rule, we are often running with a happiness limitation to growth. In these circumstances running a surplus of 4 or lower is entirely reasonable. If we're in a military conflict, running with sub-optimal growth parameters may be advantageous and/or necessary. In addition, when making a run for a world-wonder, emphasizing hammers in exchange for growth can obviously be correct. The larger issue of balancing the various intersecting factors in the game isn't the point of issue. We are isolating one segment of game-play to see what can be discovered about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](9) Granaries, Part II[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The long-term cumulative effect of granaries is quite striking. Suppose we are growing a city from size 5 to size 15 with a steady 5F food surplus. Without a granary the process will take 121 turns. With a granary the process will take 66 turns. The city without the granary requires 55(!) more turns to complete the process. This constitutes a steady delay in acquiring new tile resources, which in turn drives all other aspects of play. The default plan for any normal city accordingly must include building a granary at some point or another. The issue of when to build it is open to context, and of course there will be exceptions for cities that are geographically placed in growth-limited locations, or are peculiar in some other such way. For any normal city though, there must be some feature in the larger strategic context that overrides the default plan to make skipping the granary completely a reasonably correct decision.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](10) The State Property civic[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose that we are in the later stages of developing some particular city. We have a 3F surplus, and we intend to "complete" the city by growing onto 3 plains tiles with 1F a piece. When this is done the city will be completed in its capacity to work the maximal number of tiles it can, and will accordingly be stagnated. Growth may start up again way later when we obtain the biology tech, but we can assume this will be a long time in coming. The obvious problem which we face here is that growing onto the last tiles will take an extremely large number of turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 3F surplus is bad enough (especially when we are likely dealing with a reasonably large city already, with extended food storage requirements). Matters will only get worse though when the first cycle is completed, leaving a 2F surplus followed by the snails-pace that will arrive for the last tile with a 1F surplus. Reasonably speaking, growing onto the last tiles will take such a long time that we are largely foregoing their use. The State Property civic appears designed to assist with this. The civic is quite popular for the maintenance bonus it gives (no distance-from-palace maintenance) but it's effect on city growth strategy appears to be overlooked. In many cases we will want to build windmills on plains-hills tiles and watermills on plains-river tiles. Doing so makes both of them interchangeable at 1F 2P 1C, and they will improve later: +1P with replaceable parts and +2 commerce with electricity. The State Property civic gives a +1F bonus for windmills/watermills. What this means is that if/when we employ State Property, either as a long-term civic or as a temporary 15-20 turn choice, we will very often be able to complete cities that would otherwise take an inordinate number of turns. In the above example, suppose we have 4 windmills/watermills being worked in that city. When we adopt state property our food surplus will increase by 4F. In the process of growing onto the last 3 intended tiles, we will move from 7F to 6F to 5F in surpluses rather than from 3F to 2F to 1F. The result is that the city can grow onto those last tiles in an entirely reasonable number of turns. If/when we change out of state property[NEWLINE]afterwards our food surplus will disappear and the city will be stagnant, but working the tiles that were planned for its employ. This is often the only feasible way to enable tile utilization in the late stages of city growth - unless we want to wait for Biology (which is typically an unacceptable delay).</French>
		<German>[H1]City Growth[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Tigger70[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have been inquiring into the system of city growth in civ IV. Sufficient results have been obtained to warrant posting and discussion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A note about our topic: the fundamental dynamic at work in civ is the acquisition of rights to work game tiles. Aside from the food management issue, working such tiles yields commerce points and hammer points, and on this all else depends. Hammers are developed into units and resource multipliers (buildings); commerce generates trading options with other AI civs and, most obviously, beakers for the acquisition of techs. Managing the rate at which new tiles can be acquired is accordingly central to strategic play. This suffices as a defense regarding the significance of the topic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will proceed to list the findings of interest point-by-point. All numerical values are applicable for the correct game speed (epic speed). I have not inquired into how the system works at other speeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](1) Growth Requirements[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A city of size 1 requires acquisition of 33F to grow to size 2. A city of size 2 requires 36F, size 3 39F, size 4 42F, and so forth (temporarily setting aside the effects of a granary). So far as I can determine this system of +3 storage required per size &gt; 1 continues indefinitely. A size 20 city requires 90F stored to grow to size 21, which is in accordance with the basic pattern. The core point to note here is that there exists no "cut-off" point beyond which further growth becomes abnormally more difficult than it was before (I mean this with respect to storage requirements only. Obviously the availability of health, happiness, and so forth can present interacting factors that make further growth not possible).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](2) Food surpluses wrap after growth[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When scanning over the food bar in the city screen we might see a value of something like 42/48. What this means is that 42F surplus has been stored, with 48 required for the current growth cycle to complete. Suppose that we have a 10F surplus at this time. The city will grow at the conclusion of the present turn. On the next turn the city will show 4/51 - meaning that the extra 4F not needed for the cycle has "wrapped" over into the next cycle. This alleviates the potential need for obnoxious micro-management. Without it we would want to remove citizens from food-tiles towards the end of a cycle so as to avoid accumulating resources that will be lost. Fortunately matters do not work this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](3) Granaries, Part 1[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The granary stores 50% of the needed food in one cycle for use in the next. What this would mean in our previous example is that when the 42/48 city grows, the food bar will show 28F on the next subsequent turn. 50% of 48 = 24, plus the extra 4F which "wraps" after growth = 28F total. If we were running a food surplus of 6F in that example (thus matching the needed amount exactly), 24F would appear on the immediate following turn via the granary effect alone. Note that the next cycle would require 51F for growth, so we would see 24/51 on the next cycle. This is slightly less than 50% of what is required for the next growth increase. In practice the difference is negligible, but it is noteworthy for understanding how the system works.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](4) Population and whipping (slavery civic)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The program straightforwardly eliminates X population when whipping without doing anything else. What I mean by this: suppose we have a size 6 city with 26/48 in the food bar and we whip 2 citizens. After whipping we will show size 4, 26/42. The 26F present before the whipping operation remains. This produces outcomes that can appear weird in certain situations when not paying attention. Suppose we have a size 6 city with 46/48 and we whip two citizens. After the whipping operation we will have 46/42 with growth in 1 turn. On the next turn the city is size 5 and it appears that we whipped only 1 citizen. If we had NOT whipped the citizens, the city would have grown to size 7 on the relevant turn (assuming at least 2 food surplus). Since we DID whip the citizens, the city is size 5 on the following turn -a difference of 2 citizens, as advertised. It is a matter of understanding that only the population has been eliminated, not the stored F-values that have been accumulated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](5) Calculating the food surplus[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose we have a size 3 city working tiles (1) a farmed flood plain, (2) a mined grassland hill, and (3) another mined grassland hill. Each citizen requires 2F support. The farmed flood plain provides 4F, the mined hills 1 F a piece - yielding 6F total. Since we have 3 citizens needing 2F each, we have met the requirements and it would appear that the city should be stagnant. But it isn't. A related way of thinking about these tiles holds that the flood plain is "supporting" the mines squares. This way of thinking has its uses but it misses the point. Regarding the first observation: the city is effectively given a "0-citizen" tile to work. This is the city's base (home) tile - usually 2F 1P 1C. This "free" tiles gives a +2 food surplus if all the other tiles come out even (with respect to surplus). The above calculation is skipping the base city square - the city will have a +2F surplus because of the "free" tile. Regarding the"way of thinking" mentioned above: The art of city food maintenance is the art of managing the rate at which new tiles can be worked. This is directly tied to the city's food surplus at any given time, which in turn is the only value that matters. It is true that tiles (1), (2), and (3) will be neutral with respect to food surplus. In this sense the flood plain is "supporting" the mined squares. We don't want to manage city growth though via the roundabout method of balancing which squares are "supporting" others. Doing so constitutes a mistake in understanding what the fundamental driving factor is in managing city growth: the food surplus value, which determines the rate at which new tiles can be worked over time The two points to note here are (1) the effect of the free "0-citizen" tile in calculating the food surplus value (it usually adds +2) and (2) understanding that the core value which matters is the food-surplus number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](6) City-Growth Table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At certain stages in the game we review our cities while they are in various stages of their growth cycles. When they are midway or further in a growth cycle, changing worked tiles (and thus the food-surplus value) changes the number of turns remaining in the cycle by a considerable factor - often by 3-5 turns. City growth management however is ultimately a long-term project. We are interested in managing the number of turns required to move from size 5 to size 10, 15, and beyond. To understand the factors involved in this long-term project, we need to understand the cumulative effect of average food-surplus values over an extended period of time.

If we increase our surplus to 9F, the task will be accomplished in 5 turns instead of 7. Switching from a 3F- surplus to 6F saves 7 turns. Switching from 6F to 9F saves only 2 turns. Without a granary, a 6-F surplus is the maximally efficient number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will leave other observations to those who see them. The quick point to note is the significance of the window between the 5F and 6F surplus numbers. Running a surplus 4 or lower for any significant amount of time will yield poor and sub-optimal returns. The 5F to 6F window is entirely satisfactory and maximally efficient. Running a surplus beyond 6F will yield accelerated development, but with a lowered incremental rate of return. Beyond 6F the prospect of utilizing a zero-food citizen becomes notably more reasonable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](8) Obvious caveats[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I mention this to ward off needing to say it at some future time. There are obviously going to be situations in which other game factors are more important than managing city growth. In the window before calendar/hereditary rule, we are often running with a happiness limitation to growth. In these circumstances running a surplus of 4 or lower is entirely reasonable. If we're in a military conflict, running with sub-optimal growth parameters may be advantageous and/or necessary. In addition, when making a run for a world-wonder, emphasizing hammers in exchange for growth can obviously be correct. The larger issue of balancing the various intersecting factors in the game isn't the point of issue. We are isolating one segment of game-play to see what can be discovered about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](9) Granaries, Part II[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The long-term cumulative effect of granaries is quite striking. Suppose we are growing a city from size 5 to size 15 with a steady 5F food surplus. Without a granary the process will take 121 turns. With a granary the process will take 66 turns. The city without the granary requires 55(!) more turns to complete the process. This constitutes a steady delay in acquiring new tile resources, which in turn drives all other aspects of play. The default plan for any normal city accordingly must include building a granary at some point or another. The issue of when to build it is open to context, and of course there will be exceptions for cities that are geographically placed in growth-limited locations, or are peculiar in some other such way. For any normal city though, there must be some feature in the larger strategic context that overrides the default plan to make skipping the granary completely a reasonably correct decision.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](10) The State Property civic[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose that we are in the later stages of developing some particular city. We have a 3F surplus, and we intend to "complete" the city by growing onto 3 plains tiles with 1F a piece. When this is done the city will be completed in its capacity to work the maximal number of tiles it can, and will accordingly be stagnated. Growth may start up again way later when we obtain the biology tech, but we can assume this will be a long time in coming. The obvious problem which we face here is that growing onto the last tiles will take an extremely large number of turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 3F surplus is bad enough (especially when we are likely dealing with a reasonably large city already, with extended food storage requirements). Matters will only get worse though when the first cycle is completed, leaving a 2F surplus followed by the snails-pace that will arrive for the last tile with a 1F surplus. Reasonably speaking, growing onto the last tiles will take such a long time that we are largely foregoing their use. The State Property civic appears designed to assist with this. The civic is quite popular for the maintenance bonus it gives (no distance-from-palace maintenance) but it's effect on city growth strategy appears to be overlooked. In many cases we will want to build windmills on plains-hills tiles and watermills on plains-river tiles. Doing so makes both of them interchangeable at 1F 2P 1C, and they will improve later: +1P with replaceable parts and +2 commerce with electricity. The State Property civic gives a +1F bonus for windmills/watermills. What this means is that if/when we employ State Property, either as a long-term civic or as a temporary 15-20 turn choice, we will very often be able to complete cities that would otherwise take an inordinate number of turns. In the above example, suppose we have 4 windmills/watermills being worked in that city. When we adopt state property our food surplus will increase by 4F. In the process of growing onto the last 3 intended tiles, we will move from 7F to 6F to 5F in surpluses rather than from 3F to 2F to 1F. The result is that the city can grow onto those last tiles in an entirely reasonable number of turns. If/when we change out of state property[NEWLINE]afterwards our food surplus will disappear and the city will be stagnant, but working the tiles that were planned for its employ. This is often the only feasible way to enable tile utilization in the late stages of city growth - unless we want to wait for Biology (which is typically an unacceptable delay).</German>
		<Italian>[H1]City Growth[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Tigger70[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have been inquiring into the system of city growth in civ IV. Sufficient results have been obtained to warrant posting and discussion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A note about our topic: the fundamental dynamic at work in civ is the acquisition of rights to work game tiles. Aside from the food management issue, working such tiles yields commerce points and hammer points, and on this all else depends. Hammers are developed into units and resource multipliers (buildings); commerce generates trading options with other AI civs and, most obviously, beakers for the acquisition of techs. Managing the rate at which new tiles can be acquired is accordingly central to strategic play. This suffices as a defense regarding the significance of the topic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will proceed to list the findings of interest point-by-point. All numerical values are applicable for the correct game speed (epic speed). I have not inquired into how the system works at other speeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](1) Growth Requirements[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A city of size 1 requires acquisition of 33F to grow to size 2. A city of size 2 requires 36F, size 3 39F, size 4 42F, and so forth (temporarily setting aside the effects of a granary). So far as I can determine this system of +3 storage required per size &gt; 1 continues indefinitely. A size 20 city requires 90F stored to grow to size 21, which is in accordance with the basic pattern. The core point to note here is that there exists no "cut-off" point beyond which further growth becomes abnormally more difficult than it was before (I mean this with respect to storage requirements only. Obviously the availability of health, happiness, and so forth can present interacting factors that make further growth not possible).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](2) Food surpluses wrap after growth[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When scanning over the food bar in the city screen we might see a value of something like 42/48. What this means is that 42F surplus has been stored, with 48 required for the current growth cycle to complete. Suppose that we have a 10F surplus at this time. The city will grow at the conclusion of the present turn. On the next turn the city will show 4/51 - meaning that the extra 4F not needed for the cycle has "wrapped" over into the next cycle. This alleviates the potential need for obnoxious micro-management. Without it we would want to remove citizens from food-tiles towards the end of a cycle so as to avoid accumulating resources that will be lost. Fortunately matters do not work this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](3) Granaries, Part 1[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The granary stores 50% of the needed food in one cycle for use in the next. What this would mean in our previous example is that when the 42/48 city grows, the food bar will show 28F on the next subsequent turn. 50% of 48 = 24, plus the extra 4F which "wraps" after growth = 28F total. If we were running a food surplus of 6F in that example (thus matching the needed amount exactly), 24F would appear on the immediate following turn via the granary effect alone. Note that the next cycle would require 51F for growth, so we would see 24/51 on the next cycle. This is slightly less than 50% of what is required for the next growth increase. In practice the difference is negligible, but it is noteworthy for understanding how the system works.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](4) Population and whipping (slavery civic)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The program straightforwardly eliminates X population when whipping without doing anything else. What I mean by this: suppose we have a size 6 city with 26/48 in the food bar and we whip 2 citizens. After whipping we will show size 4, 26/42. The 26F present before the whipping operation remains. This produces outcomes that can appear weird in certain situations when not paying attention. Suppose we have a size 6 city with 46/48 and we whip two citizens. After the whipping operation we will have 46/42 with growth in 1 turn. On the next turn the city is size 5 and it appears that we whipped only 1 citizen. If we had NOT whipped the citizens, the city would have grown to size 7 on the relevant turn (assuming at least 2 food surplus). Since we DID whip the citizens, the city is size 5 on the following turn -a difference of 2 citizens, as advertised. It is a matter of understanding that only the population has been eliminated, not the stored F-values that have been accumulated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](5) Calculating the food surplus[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose we have a size 3 city working tiles (1) a farmed flood plain, (2) a mined grassland hill, and (3) another mined grassland hill. Each citizen requires 2F support. The farmed flood plain provides 4F, the mined hills 1 F a piece - yielding 6F total. Since we have 3 citizens needing 2F each, we have met the requirements and it would appear that the city should be stagnant. But it isn't. A related way of thinking about these tiles holds that the flood plain is "supporting" the mines squares. This way of thinking has its uses but it misses the point. Regarding the first observation: the city is effectively given a "0-citizen" tile to work. This is the city's base (home) tile - usually 2F 1P 1C. This "free" tiles gives a +2 food surplus if all the other tiles come out even (with respect to surplus). The above calculation is skipping the base city square - the city will have a +2F surplus because of the "free" tile. Regarding the"way of thinking" mentioned above: The art of city food maintenance is the art of managing the rate at which new tiles can be worked. This is directly tied to the city's food surplus at any given time, which in turn is the only value that matters. It is true that tiles (1), (2), and (3) will be neutral with respect to food surplus. In this sense the flood plain is "supporting" the mined squares. We don't want to manage city growth though via the roundabout method of balancing which squares are "supporting" others. Doing so constitutes a mistake in understanding what the fundamental driving factor is in managing city growth: the food surplus value, which determines the rate at which new tiles can be worked over time The two points to note here are (1) the effect of the free "0-citizen" tile in calculating the food surplus value (it usually adds +2) and (2) understanding that the core value which matters is the food-surplus number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](6) City-Growth Table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At certain stages in the game we review our cities while they are in various stages of their growth cycles. When they are midway or further in a growth cycle, changing worked tiles (and thus the food-surplus value) changes the number of turns remaining in the cycle by a considerable factor - often by 3-5 turns. City growth management however is ultimately a long-term project. We are interested in managing the number of turns required to move from size 5 to size 10, 15, and beyond. To understand the factors involved in this long-term project, we need to understand the cumulative effect of average food-surplus values over an extended period of time. The following chart is a tool I have put together for this purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]1[TAB][TAB]2[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4[TAB][TAB]5[NEWLINE]1[TAB]33[TAB][TAB]36/20[TAB][TAB]39/21[TAB][TAB]42/23[TAB][TAB]45/24[NEWLINE]2[TAB]17[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[TAB][TAB]21/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[NEWLINE]3[TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]4[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[NEWLINE]5[TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]6[TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]7[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]8[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]9[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]10[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]11[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8[TAB][TAB]9[TAB][TAB]10[NEWLINE]1[TAB]48/26[TAB][TAB]51/27[TAB][TAB]54/29[TAB][TAB]57/30[TAB][TAB]60/32[NEWLINE]2[TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]26/14[TAB][TAB]27/15[TAB][TAB]29/15[TAB][TAB]30/16[NEWLINE]3[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[NEWLINE]4[TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]5[TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]6[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[NEWLINE]7[TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]8[TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]9[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]10[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12[TAB][TAB]13[TAB][TAB]14[TAB][TAB]15[NEWLINE]1[TAB]63/33[TAB][TAB]66/35[TAB][TAB]69/36[TAB][TAB]72/38[TAB][TAB]75/39[NEWLINE]2[TAB]32/17[TAB][TAB]33/18[TAB][TAB]35/18[TAB][TAB]36/19[TAB][TAB]38/20[NEWLINE]3[TAB]21/11[TAB][TAB]22/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[TAB][TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]25/13[NEWLINE]4[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[NEWLINE]5[TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]6[TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]7[TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[NEWLINE]8[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[NEWLINE]9[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]10[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]12[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rows are food-surplus values, while the columns indicate current city size. Each cell consists of two numbers. The first number gives the number of turns required for city growth if the city does not have a granary. The second number provides the number of turns required if the city does have a granary (and it was functional during the previous growth cycle). The table does not take into account the food-wrap issue discussed above. What this means is that sometimes we will save a turn from the provided number. For example suppose we are running a 10 -surplus city at size 4. 42F is required to advance. On the 5th turn the city will grow, resulting in 8/45 at the start of the next cycle. With 8 food stored, we will need 4 turns to reach 48/45 and thus to grow again. The chart however indicates 5 turns (not 4) since that is the number of turns that would be required if we had zero food at the start of the relevant cycle. Note what happens here though. We will move from 48/45 to 3/48 at size 6. Here 5 turns will be required, as indicated in the chart. In short, the food-wrapping effect intermittently permits us to save one turn. In the long-term however the number of saved turns is largely the same regardless of which row (and thus which average food-surplus is being used). This permits us to ignore the effect for relative comparisons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](7) Observations from the City-Growth table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The key feature to note from the table is the significance of running a 5-food surplus (with a granary) or a 6-food surplus (without a granary). Running a surplus of 4 or less comes with a very significant cost in long-term growth. Running a surplus higher than 5 or 6 does bring distinct advantages. These advantages however are considerably more incremental in character than they are at the lower values. Beyond a food-surplus value of around 6, working a zero-food citizen (mined plains tile, specialist, etc.) is considerably more palatable than it is at lower surplus values [note: the decision to work a zero-food citizen is significant since the cost of doing so lowers the food-surplus value by 2, as opposed to lowering only by 1 working a mined grassland hills or maintaining the current surplus by working a grassland pot (cottage)].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some quick observations to help make this point. Suppose that we are growing a size 3 city to size 4. Without a granary, this requires 14 turns with a 3F surplus. It requires only 7 turns with a 6F surplus, accomplishing the task 50% faster. A second case: suppose we are growing a city from size 3 to size 6 (without a granary). Using a 3F surplus requires 42 turns; using a 5F surplus requires 26 turns. Again, the difference is remarkable. On the other hand: we grow from size 3 to size 4 in 7 turns using a 6F surplus. If we increase our surplus to 9F, the task will be accomplished in 5 turns instead of 7. Switching from a 3F- surplus to 6F saves 7 turns. Switching from 6F to 9F saves only 2 turns. Without a granary, a 6-F surplus is the maximally efficient number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will leave other observations to those who see them. The quick point to note is the significance of the window between the 5F and 6F surplus numbers. Running a surplus 4 or lower for any significant amount of time will yield poor and sub-optimal returns. The 5F to 6F window is entirely satisfactory and maximally efficient.

Since we have 3 citizens needing 2F each, we have met the requirements and it would appear that the city should be stagnant. But it isn't. A related way of thinking about these tiles holds that the flood plain is "supporting" the mines squares. This way of thinking has its uses but it misses the point. Regarding the first observation: the city is effectively given a "0-citizen" tile to work. This is the city's base (home) tile - usually 2F 1P 1C. This "free" tiles gives a +2 food surplus if all the other tiles come out even (with respect to surplus). The above calculation is skipping the base city square - the city will have a +2F surplus because of the "free" tile. Regarding the"way of thinking" mentioned above: The art of city food maintenance is the art of managing the rate at which new tiles can be worked. This is directly tied to the city's food surplus at any given time, which in turn is the only value that matters. It is true that tiles (1), (2), and (3) will be neutral with respect to food surplus. In this sense the flood plain is "supporting" the mined squares. We don't want to manage city growth though via the roundabout method of balancing which squares are "supporting" others. Doing so constitutes a mistake in understanding what the fundamental driving factor is in managing city growth: the food surplus value, which determines the rate at which new tiles can be worked over time The two points to note here are (1) the effect of the free "0-citizen" tile in calculating the food surplus value (it usually adds +2) and (2) understanding that the core value which matters is the food-surplus number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](6) City-Growth Table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At certain stages in the game we review our cities while they are in various stages of their growth cycles. When they are midway or further in a growth cycle, changing worked tiles (and thus the food-surplus value) changes the number of turns remaining in the cycle by a considerable factor - often by 3-5 turns. City growth management however is ultimately a long-term project. We are interested in managing the number of turns required to move from size 5 to size 10, 15, and beyond. To understand the factors involved in this long-term project, we need to understand the cumulative effect of average food-surplus values over an extended period of time. The following chart is a tool I have put together for this purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]1[TAB][TAB]2[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4[TAB][TAB]5[NEWLINE]1[TAB]33[TAB][TAB]36/20[TAB][TAB]39/21[TAB][TAB]42/23[TAB][TAB]45/24[NEWLINE]2[TAB]17[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[TAB][TAB]21/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[NEWLINE]3[TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]4[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[NEWLINE]5[TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]6[TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]7[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]8[TAB]5[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]9[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]10[TAB]4[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]11[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[TAB][TAB]4/2[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]7[TAB][TAB]8[TAB][TAB]9[TAB][TAB]10[NEWLINE]1[TAB]48/26[TAB][TAB]51/27[TAB][TAB]54/29[TAB][TAB]57/30[TAB][TAB]60/32[NEWLINE]2[TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]26/14[TAB][TAB]27/15[TAB][TAB]29/15[TAB][TAB]30/16[NEWLINE]3[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[TAB][TAB]20/11[NEWLINE]4[TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]5[TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]6[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[NEWLINE]7[TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]8[TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]9[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]10[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[NEWLINE]12[TAB]4/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[TAB][TAB]5/3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]11[TAB][TAB]12[TAB][TAB]13[TAB][TAB]14[TAB][TAB]15[NEWLINE]1[TAB]63/33[TAB][TAB]66/35[TAB][TAB]69/36[TAB][TAB]72/38[TAB][TAB]75/39[NEWLINE]2[TAB]32/17[TAB][TAB]33/18[TAB][TAB]35/18[TAB][TAB]36/19[TAB][TAB]38/20[NEWLINE]3[TAB]21/11[TAB][TAB]22/12[TAB][TAB]23/12[TAB][TAB]24/13[TAB][TAB]25/13[NEWLINE]4[TAB]16/9[TAB][TAB]17/9[TAB][TAB]18/9[TAB][TAB]18/10[TAB][TAB]19/10[NEWLINE]5[TAB]13/7[TAB][TAB]14/7[TAB][TAB]14/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[TAB][TAB]15/8[NEWLINE]6[TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[TAB][TAB]12/6[TAB][TAB]12/7[TAB][TAB]12/7[NEWLINE]7[TAB]10/5[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]10/6[TAB][TAB]11/6[NEWLINE]8[TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[TAB][TAB]10/5[NEWLINE]9[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/5[TAB][TAB]9/5[NEWLINE]10[TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[TAB][TAB]8/4[NEWLINE]11[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE]12[TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/3[TAB][TAB]6/4[TAB][TAB]7/4[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rows are food-surplus values, while the columns indicate current city size. Each cell consists of two numbers. The first number gives the number of turns required for city growth if the city does not have a granary. The second number provides the number of turns required if the city does have a granary (and it was functional during the previous growth cycle). The table does not take into account the food-wrap issue discussed above. What this means is that sometimes we will save a turn from the provided number. For example suppose we are running a 10 -surplus city at size 4. 42F is required to advance. On the 5th turn the city will grow, resulting in 8/45 at the start of the next cycle. With 8 food stored, we will need 4 turns to reach 48/45 and thus to grow again. The chart however indicates 5 turns (not 4) since that is the number of turns that would be required if we had zero food at the start of the relevant cycle. Note what happens here though. We will move from 48/45 to 3/48 at size 6. Here 5 turns will be required, as indicated in the chart. In short, the food-wrapping effect intermittently permits us to save one turn. In the long-term however the number of saved turns is largely the same regardless of which row (and thus which average food-surplus is being used). This permits us to ignore the effect for relative comparisons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](7) Observations from the City-Growth table[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The key feature to note from the table is the significance of running a 5-food surplus (with a granary) or a 6-food surplus (without a granary). Running a surplus of 4 or less comes with a very significant cost in long-term growth. Running a surplus higher than 5 or 6 does bring distinct advantages. These advantages however are considerably more incremental in character than they are at the lower values. Beyond a food-surplus value of around 6, working a zero-food citizen (mined plains tile, specialist, etc.) is considerably more palatable than it is at lower surplus values [note: the decision to work a zero-food citizen is significant since the cost of doing so lowers the food-surplus value by 2, as opposed to lowering only by 1 working a mined grassland hills or maintaining the current surplus by working a grassland pot (cottage)].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some quick observations to help make this point. Suppose that we are growing a size 3 city to size 4. Without a granary, this requires 14 turns with a 3F surplus. It requires only 7 turns with a 6F surplus, accomplishing the task 50% faster. A second case: suppose we are growing a city from size 3 to size 6 (without a granary). Using a 3F surplus requires 42 turns; using a 5F surplus requires 26 turns. Again, the difference is remarkable. On the other hand: we grow from size 3 to size 4 in 7 turns using a 6F surplus. If we increase our surplus to 9F, the task will be accomplished in 5 turns instead of 7. Switching from a 3F- surplus to 6F saves 7 turns. Switching from 6F to 9F saves only 2 turns. Without a granary, a 6-F surplus is the maximally efficient number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I will leave other observations to those who see them. The quick point to note is the significance of the window between the 5F and 6F surplus numbers. Running a surplus 4 or lower for any significant amount of time will yield poor and sub-optimal returns. The 5F to 6F window is entirely satisfactory and maximally efficient. Running a surplus beyond 6F will yield accelerated development, but with a lowered incremental rate of return. Beyond 6F the prospect of utilizing a zero-food citizen becomes notably more reasonable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](8) Obvious caveats[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I mention this to ward off needing to say it at some future time. There are obviously going to be situations in which other game factors are more important than managing city growth. In the window before calendar/hereditary rule, we are often running with a happiness limitation to growth. In these circumstances running a surplus of 4 or lower is entirely reasonable. If we're in a military conflict, running with sub-optimal growth parameters may be advantageous and/or necessary. In addition, when making a run for a world-wonder, emphasizing hammers in exchange for growth can obviously be correct. The larger issue of balancing the various intersecting factors in the game isn't the point of issue. We are isolating one segment of game-play to see what can be discovered about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](9) Granaries, Part II[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The long-term cumulative effect of granaries is quite striking. Suppose we are growing a city from size 5 to size 15 with a steady 5F food surplus. Without a granary the process will take 121 turns. With a granary the process will take 66 turns. The city without the granary requires 55(!) more turns to complete the process. This constitutes a steady delay in acquiring new tile resources, which in turn drives all other aspects of play. The default plan for any normal city accordingly must include building a granary at some point or another. The issue of when to build it is open to context, and of course there will be exceptions for cities that are geographically placed in growth-limited locations, or are peculiar in some other such way. For any normal city though, there must be some feature in the larger strategic context that overrides the default plan to make skipping the granary completely a reasonably correct decision.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2](10) The State Property civic[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Suppose that we are in the later stages of developing some particular city. We have a 3F surplus, and we intend to "complete" the city by growing onto 3 plains tiles with 1F a piece. When this is done the city will be completed in its capacity to work the maximal number of tiles it can, and will accordingly be stagnated. Growth may start up again way later when we obtain the biology tech, but we can assume this will be a long time in coming. The obvious problem which we face here is that growing onto the last tiles will take an extremely large number of turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 3F surplus is bad enough (especially when we are likely dealing with a reasonably large city already, with extended food storage requirements). Matters will only get worse though when the first cycle is completed, leaving a 2F surplus followed by the snails-pace that will arrive for the last tile with a 1F surplus. Reasonably speaking, growing onto the last tiles will take such a long time that we are largely foregoing their use. The State Property civic appears designed to assist with this. The civic is quite popular for the maintenance bonus it gives (no distance-from-palace maintenance) but it's effect on city growth strategy appears to be overlooked. In many cases we will want to build windmills on plains-hills tiles and watermills on plains-river tiles. Doing so makes both of them interchangeable at 1F 2P 1C, and they will improve later: +1P with replaceable parts and +2 commerce with electricity. The State Property civic gives a +1F bonus for windmills/watermills. What this means is that if/when we employ State Property, either as a long-term civic or as a temporary 15-20 turn choice, we will very often be able to complete cities that would otherwise take an inordinate number of turns. In the above example, suppose we have 4 windmills/watermills being worked in that city. When we adopt state property our food surplus will increase by 4F. In the process of growing onto the last 3 intended tiles, we will move from 7F to 6F to 5F in surpluses rather than from 3F to 2F to 1F. The result is that the city can grow onto those last tiles in an entirely reasonable number of turns. If/when we change out of state property[NEWLINE]afterwards our food surplus will disappear and the city will be stagnant, but working the tiles that were planned for its employ. This is often the only feasible way to enable tile utilization in the late stages of city growth - unless we want to wait for Biology (which is typically an unacceptable delay).</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]The Curious Cat - City Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Gato Loco[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]NOTE: I believe that patch 1.52 changed the specifics for city upkeep. Be warned that upkeep is apparently higher than it was under the original release.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the much-discussed new features in Civ4 is the introduction of the supposedly ICS-killing city maintenance. In preview after preview, we were told that REX* the rabid settler dog has finally been put down or at least kept on a tight leash. For the first time, a city can actually lose you money. However, old habits die hard and we're already seeing claims in these forums that the ability to chop for settlers will leave this old dog tearing up the backyard for years to come. In the interest of tossing old REX a bone, I've attempted to dissect the city maintenance system to figure out how well it does its job. I have conducted a series of experiments to determine exactly how long the leash is. All experiments were conducted under the following settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Difficulty = Monarch[NEWLINE]World Size = Standard[NEWLINE]Game speed = Standard[NEWLINE]Civ = Arabs (Chose a non-organized leader just in case it has an effect)[NEWLINE]Map = Great Plains (For maximum freedom placing cities)[NEWLINE]Civics = all default[NEWLINE]All tests were conducted with the world-builder on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*REX = Rapid EXpansion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 1 = Number of cities maintenance:[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For this test I founded the capitol in the middle of a large open area and began placing new cities within 3 tiles of the palace. At this distance I had already observed that there is no distance-based city maintenance. Note that the world-builder is capable of placing cities in adjacent tiles even though this is not allowed in the game. All cities were connected to the trade network by default, although in another test I confirmed that this does not seem to affect city maintenance, at least for cities within 10 tiles or so of the palace (unlike corruption in Civ3). I then observed the amount of city maintenance for each additional city. The first observation is that the maintenance from the number of cities is not the same for each city. This is probably to avoid exploitable rounding errors which would occur if the value were evened out over every city, as happened with the ring city placement bug in civ3 vanilla. Instead, each additional city raises the maintenance slightly in a select number of existing cities. I did not determine the formula used for selecting cities but instead graphed the increase in maintenance per turn for each additional city. As the game runs very slow on my computer, I did not go through the process of separating out city maintenance and civic maintenance, but I checked on several occasions and found civic maintenance to be roughly 10% of city maintenance. This would presumably be significantly higher if you run expensive civics, and it appears to scale roughly with city maintenance, so if you plan to spam cities and run a hereditary police state with organized religion, the organized trait may actually give you a noticeable benefit. What's more, the manual claims that civic costs also increase as total population increases (p.83), so I could picture it getting pretty high in certain cases.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/marginalupkeep.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As shown by the graph, the cost in gpt of a new city increases as you add more cities. There is a discontinuity around ten cities after which the cost rises sharply, making 9-10 the optimal number on a standard map before massive city upkeep starts to kick in. After this, the marginal upkeep rate increases until your 28th city costs you 14 gpt! Note that this city will not show 14 gpt in city maintenance. Much of the upkeep is distributed as a slight increase across other cities. After this point the marginal increase in upkeep falls dramatically, to 6-7 extra gpt per city. This is because the number of cities component of city maintenance can never exceed 6 gpt per city, so once all your cities are maxed out this component can never exceed 6 times the number of cities. In my observations, the number exceeded this value because of civic upkeep. This is good news for warmongers because once you have conquered 30 cities, future conquests will be a little less painful, especially if you run state property to eliminate the (probably huge) distance based component for your world-spanning empire. As an aside, each holy city potentially gives you 1 gpt for each city you own, so owning 6 holy cities will pay all of your number-based city upkeep if you relentlessly spam missionaries. Owning all seven will turn a profit on state property! If you're hell-bent on ICSing, I would recommend the Arabs. You start with Mysticism so you have a chance at grabbing lots of religions early and the philosophical trait should lead to quick great prophets to found the appropriate shrines. Call it the "Babylon" strategy after the villain in the "Left Behind" series who tries to conquer the world by founding a universal syncretistic religion. Commie Universalist Arabs take over the world! Oh My![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 2 = Distance-Based Maintenance[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][Update - the value established in this section is a minimum. Some undetermined factor can increase distance upkeep to more than this amount. Thanks to Requies for noticing this][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To test distance-based corruption, I created a horizontal line of 30 cities with the palace at one end and measured the distance-based component of maintenance for each one. The results are shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/horizdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It appears that on the settings used, the distance-based corruption is equal to the distance to the palace divided by 4.5, as long as the city in question is along a straight axis from the palace. I also tested distance along a diagonal distance and found that the diagonal distance does not obey Pythagoras' theorem. Instead it appears that the program counts diagonal distance as equaling 1.5 times the value of horizontal distance, rounded down. This makes sense as this was the method used to calculate distance in Civ3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/diagdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/fulldist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is great news because anyone who's ever done an RCP in vanilla Civ3 knows how to calculate rings on the map. There's even a utility to do it for you. The trick is to map out the rings of the appropriate distances (4,9,13,18,etc.) and place your cities inside those rings to avoid increasing distance upkeep. Pictured below is a formation that I'm naming the "Cheesy Circle"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/ironring.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ring of red X's shows the distance at which you start paying distance upkeep. This formation (when used on standard maps) gives you nine cities with no distance upkeep and 16 gpt in number-based upkeep, for less than 2 gpt/city. Each city can work over 12 tiles, which should be enough to exhaust their health and happiness anyway. Ideally, you spam settlers to build the circle (at minimal upkeep cost), then develop the cities into high-shield military bases for a classical-age swordsman rush.** The only drawback is that you may miss out on resources by having such a compact territory. In practice it may be best to put some of the cities into the 1-upkeep region to obtain much-needed special resources, such as iron.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]**This is a theoretical strategy at the moment. Next time I start a new game I'll try some variation of this layout. It would seem perfect for the first GOTM (Expansive leader, hill/grass/river start, great swordsman UU)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 3 - Do I have a life?[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No. But you don't either if you're still reading this.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In conclusion, city maintenance works more or less as advertised. The main headaches will come from having too many cities, but distance upkeep could potentially be annoying for small colonies in faraway lands. Consider carefully before founding a little city on a faraway continent for the sole purpose of claiming a banana resource, especially if you can get bananas by trading with your friends. Since many of the numbers are rounded, it is possible to take advantage of the system to minimize your city upkeep and play a more efficient game. I expect that some version of these calculations will figure in high-level civ4 play once there is such a thing as high-level civ4 play. Unless, of course, Firaxis decides to play with the formula in a patch or expansion, just like they did with ring city placement. Given their stated commitment to reducing the amount of math necessary to play the game, it is a likely possibility.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Please feel free to test and comment on my observations. They are as yet incomplete and any input is appreciated. I'll update once I figure out the answers to remaining questions, such as how upkeep works on different world sizes and what the formula for civic upkeep is.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Addendum - Courthouses and the upkeep limit[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to confirm the nature of the 6-upkeep limit for number of city upkeep, I placed 50 cities on a standard map and started filling them with courthouses. The courthouse affects the upkeep after the cap has been applied, so with courthouses in every city and state property, you should be able to pay only 3 gpt per city. While controlling all 7 holy cities and converting every city might be a pipe dream, doing this for 3-4 religions should be doable for would-be conquerors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Update - Difficulty level and City Upkeep[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After placing large numbers of cities in Warlord difficulty, it appears that difficulty level does affect upkeep. However, it does not affect the OCN. In warlord level, as in Monarch level, costs begin to accelerate after the tenth city. However, once the OCN is reached, costs increase at about 75% of the rate they do on Monarch. Since the OCN is unchanged, city placement shouldn't be that different on different difficulty levels, but it may be possible to squeeze a few more cities in at lower levels. A comparison is shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/monvswar.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also note that:[NEWLINE]Warlord maxes out at 5 gpt per city[NEWLINE]It takes longer for Warlord to max out city costs than Monarch. Thus there are actually certain points at which the next city costs more under Warlord, though the total upkeep is still less.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Civic Upkeep[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For this test, I started adding more and more size 1 cities and watching the additional civic upkeep for each one (F3). Preliminary tests indicate that on a standard map you start paying a flat fee for each size 1 city beyond the tenth. The amount comes to slightly less than 1 gpt per city for the starting civics. While it would be possible to catalogue rounding errors and exploit them the payoff would be very small and would need to take into account many possible combinations of city number, city size, and civic options, and would come to no more than 1 gpt anyway since civic upkeep, unlike distance upkeep, is one single lump sum rather than a bunch of small, separately rounded numbers. City size also increases civic upkeep, though to a lesser degree, especially in small numbers of very large cities. Each civic appears to contribute 1/5 of the cost, as determined by switching 2 civics to no upkeep. High upkeep is also much more expensive than low upkeep, as switching to organized religion increased upkeep from 50 to 74 gpt, apparently boosting the religion share of upkeep by 3.5 times (10 gpt to 34 gpt)! City upkeep at this point was ~350 gpt without courthouses, so it appears that under the most expensive civics available one could boost civic upkeep to the point where it could compare with city upkeep. And since courthouses do not affect civic upkeep, the cost of a large empire would be enough to make a would-be world conqueror think twice about high or even medium upkeep civics (no hereditary police states, please). Given this data, I strongly suspect that the organized trait has gotten a bum rap and will find its usefulness in domination games.</English>

This would presumably be significantly higher if you run expensive civics, and it appears to scale roughly with city maintenance, so if you plan to spam cities and run a hereditary police state with organized religion, the organized trait may actually give you a noticeable benefit. What's more, the manual claims that civic costs also increase as total population increases (p.83), so I could picture it getting pretty high in certain cases.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/marginalupkeep.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As shown by the graph, the cost in gpt of a new city increases as you add more cities. There is a discontinuity around ten cities after which the cost rises sharply, making 9-10 the optimal number on a standard map before massive city upkeep starts to kick in. After this, the marginal upkeep rate increases until your 28th city costs you 14 gpt! Note that this city will not show 14 gpt in city maintenance. Much of the upkeep is distributed as a slight increase across other cities. After this point the marginal increase in upkeep falls dramatically, to 6-7 extra gpt per city. This is because the number of cities component of city maintenance can never exceed 6 gpt per city, so once all your cities are maxed out this component can never exceed 6 times the number of cities. In my observations, the number exceeded this value because of civic upkeep. This is good news for warmongers because once you have conquered 30 cities, future conquests will be a little less painful, especially if you run state property to eliminate the (probably huge) distance based component for your world-spanning empire. As an aside, each holy city potentially gives you 1 gpt for each city you own, so owning 6 holy cities will pay all of your number-based city upkeep if you relentlessly spam missionaries.

Thanks to Requies for noticing this][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To test distance-based corruption, I created a horizontal line of 30 cities with the palace at one end and measured the distance-based component of maintenance for each one. The results are shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/horizdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It appears that on the settings used, the distance-based corruption is equal to the distance to the palace divided by 4.5, as long as the city in question is along a straight axis from the palace. I also tested distance along a diagonal distance and found that the diagonal distance does not obey Pythagoras' theorem. Instead it appears that the program counts diagonal distance as equaling 1.5 times the value of horizontal distance, rounded down. This makes sense as this was the method used to calculate distance in Civ3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/diagdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/fulldist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is great news because anyone who's ever done an RCP in vanilla Civ3 knows how to calculate rings on the map. There's even a utility to do it for you. The trick is to map out the rings of the appropriate distances (4,9,13,18,etc.) and place your cities inside those rings to avoid increasing distance upkeep.

Ideally, you spam settlers to build the circle (at minimal upkeep cost), then develop the cities into high-shield military bases for a classical-age swordsman rush.** The only drawback is that you may miss out on resources by having such a compact territory.

Since many of the numbers are rounded, it is possible to take advantage of the system to minimize your city upkeep and play a more efficient game. I expect that some version of these calculations will figure in high-level civ4 play once there is such a thing as high-level civ4 play. Unless, of course, Firaxis decides to play with the formula in a patch or expansion, just like they did with ring city placement. Given their stated commitment to reducing the amount of math necessary to play the game, it is a likely possibility.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Please feel free to test and comment on my observations. They are as yet incomplete and any input is appreciated. I'll update once I figure out the answers to remaining questions, such as how upkeep works on different world sizes and what the formula for civic upkeep is.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Addendum - Courthouses and the upkeep limit[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to confirm the nature of the 6-upkeep limit for number of city upkeep, I placed 50 cities on a standard map and started filling them with courthouses. The courthouse affects the upkeep after the cap has been applied, so with courthouses in every city and state property, you should be able to pay only 3 gpt per city. While controlling all 7 holy cities and converting every city might be a pipe dream, doing this for 3-4 religions should be doable for would-be conquerors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Update - Difficulty level and City Upkeep[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After placing large numbers of cities in Warlord difficulty, it appears that difficulty level does affect upkeep. However, it does not affect the OCN. In warlord level, as in Monarch level, costs begin to accelerate after the tenth city. However, once the OCN is reached, costs increase at about 75% of the rate they do on Monarch. Since the OCN is unchanged, city placement shouldn't be that different on different difficulty levels, but it may be possible to squeeze a few more cities in at lower levels. A comparison is shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/monvswar.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also note that:[NEWLINE]Warlord maxes out at 5 gpt per city[NEWLINE]It takes longer for Warlord to max out city costs than Monarch. Thus there are actually certain points at which the next city costs more under Warlord, though the total upkeep is still less.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Civic Upkeep[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For this test, I started adding more and more size 1 cities and watching the additional civic upkeep for each one (F3). Preliminary tests indicate that on a standard map you start paying a flat fee for each size 1 city beyond the tenth. The amount comes to slightly less than 1 gpt per city for the starting civics. While it would be possible to catalogue rounding errors and exploit them the payoff would be very small and would need to take into account many possible combinations of city number, city size, and civic options, and would come to no more than 1 gpt anyway since civic upkeep, unlike distance upkeep, is one single lump sum rather than a bunch of small, separately rounded numbers. City size also increases civic upkeep, though to a lesser degree, especially in small numbers of very large cities. Each civic appears to contribute 1/5 of the cost, as determined by switching 2 civics to no upkeep. High upkeep is also much more expensive than low upkeep, as switching to organized religion increased upkeep from 50 to 74 gpt, apparently boosting the religion share of upkeep by 3.5 times (10 gpt to 34 gpt)! City upkeep at this point was ~350 gpt without courthouses, so it appears that under the most expensive civics available one could boost civic upkeep to the point where it could compare with city upkeep. And since courthouses do not affect civic upkeep, the cost of a large empire would be enough to make a would-be world conqueror think twice about high or even medium upkeep civics (no hereditary police states, please). Given this data, I strongly suspect that the organized trait has gotten a bum rap and will find its usefulness in domination games.</French>
		<German>[H1]The Curious Cat - City Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Gato Loco[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]NOTE: I believe that patch 1.52 changed the specifics for city upkeep. Be warned that upkeep is apparently higher than it was under the original release.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the much-discussed new features in Civ4 is the introduction of the supposedly ICS-killing city maintenance. In preview after preview, we were told that REX* the rabid settler dog has finally been put down or at least kept on a tight leash. For the first time, a city can actually lose you money. However, old habits die hard and we're already seeing claims in these forums that the ability to chop for settlers will leave this old dog tearing up the backyard for years to come. In the interest of tossing old REX a bone, I've attempted to dissect the city maintenance system to figure out how well it does its job. I have conducted a series of experiments to determine exactly how long the leash is.

At this distance I had already observed that there is no distance-based city maintenance. Note that the world-builder is capable of placing cities in adjacent tiles even though this is not allowed in the game. All cities were connected to the trade network by default, although in another test I confirmed that this does not seem to affect city maintenance, at least for cities within 10 tiles or so of the palace (unlike corruption in Civ3). I then observed the amount of city maintenance for each additional city. The first observation is that the maintenance from the number of cities is not the same for each city. This is probably to avoid exploitable rounding errors which would occur if the value were evened out over every city, as happened with the ring city placement bug in civ3 vanilla.

While it would be possible to catalogue rounding errors and exploit them the payoff would be very small and would need to take into account many possible combinations of city number, city size, and civic options, and would come to no more than 1 gpt anyway since civic upkeep, unlike distance upkeep, is one single lump sum rather than a bunch of small, separately rounded numbers. City size also increases civic upkeep, though to a lesser degree, especially in small numbers of very large cities. Each civic appears to contribute 1/5 of the cost, as determined by switching 2 civics to no upkeep. High upkeep is also much more expensive than low upkeep, as switching to organized religion increased upkeep from 50 to 74 gpt, apparently boosting the religion share of upkeep by 3.5 times (10 gpt to 34 gpt)! City upkeep at this point was ~350 gpt without courthouses, so it appears that under the most expensive civics available one could boost civic upkeep to the point where it could compare with city upkeep. And since courthouses do not affect civic upkeep, the cost of a large empire would be enough to make a would-be world conqueror think twice about high or even medium upkeep civics (no hereditary police states, please). Given this data, I strongly suspect that the organized trait has gotten a bum rap and will find its usefulness in domination games.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]The Curious Cat - City Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Gato Loco[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]NOTE: I believe that patch 1.52 changed the specifics for city upkeep. Be warned that upkeep is apparently higher than it was under the original release.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the much-discussed new features in Civ4 is the introduction of the supposedly ICS-killing city maintenance. In preview after preview, we were told that REX* the rabid settler dog has finally been put down or at least kept on a tight leash. For the first time, a city can actually lose you money. However, old habits die hard and we're already seeing claims in these forums that the ability to chop for settlers will leave this old dog tearing up the backyard for years to come. In the interest of tossing old REX a bone, I've attempted to dissect the city maintenance system to figure out how well it does its job. I have conducted a series of experiments to determine exactly how long the leash is. All experiments were conducted under the following settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Difficulty = Monarch[NEWLINE]World Size = Standard[NEWLINE]Game speed = Standard[NEWLINE]Civ = Arabs (Chose a non-organized leader just in case it has an effect)[NEWLINE]Map = Great Plains (For maximum freedom placing cities)[NEWLINE]Civics = all default[NEWLINE]All tests were conducted with the world-builder on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*REX = Rapid EXpansion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 1 = Number of cities maintenance:[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For this test I founded the capitol in the middle of a large open area and began placing new cities within 3 tiles of the palace. At this distance I had already observed that there is no distance-based city maintenance. Note that the world-builder is capable of placing cities in adjacent tiles even though this is not allowed in the game. All cities were connected to the trade network by default, although in another test I confirmed that this does not seem to affect city maintenance, at least for cities within 10 tiles or so of the palace (unlike corruption in Civ3). I then observed the amount of city maintenance for each additional city. The first observation is that the maintenance from the number of cities is not the same for each city. This is probably to avoid exploitable rounding errors which would occur if the value were evened out over every city, as happened with the ring city placement bug in civ3 vanilla. Instead, each additional city raises the maintenance slightly in a select number of existing cities. I did not determine the formula used for selecting cities but instead graphed the increase in maintenance per turn for each additional city. As the game runs very slow on my computer, I did not go through the process of separating out city maintenance and civic maintenance, but I checked on several occasions and found civic maintenance to be roughly 10% of city maintenance. This would presumably be significantly higher if you run expensive civics, and it appears to scale roughly with city maintenance, so if you plan to spam cities and run a hereditary police state with organized religion, the organized trait may actually give you a noticeable benefit. What's more, the manual claims that civic costs also increase as total population increases (p.83), so I could picture it getting pretty high in certain cases.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/marginalupkeep.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As shown by the graph, the cost in gpt of a new city increases as you add more cities. There is a discontinuity around ten cities after which the cost rises sharply, making 9-10 the optimal number on a standard map before massive city upkeep starts to kick in. After this, the marginal upkeep rate increases until your 28th city costs you 14 gpt! Note that this city will not show 14 gpt in city maintenance. Much of the upkeep is distributed as a slight increase across other cities. After this point the marginal increase in upkeep falls dramatically, to 6-7 extra gpt per city. This is because the number of cities component of city maintenance can never exceed 6 gpt per city, so once all your cities are maxed out this component can never exceed 6 times the number of cities. In my observations, the number exceeded this value because of civic upkeep. This is good news for warmongers because once you have conquered 30 cities, future conquests will be a little less painful, especially if you run state property to eliminate the (probably huge) distance based component for your world-spanning empire. As an aside, each holy city potentially gives you 1 gpt for each city you own, so owning 6 holy cities will pay all of your number-based city upkeep if you relentlessly spam missionaries. Owning all seven will turn a profit on state property! If you're hell-bent on ICSing, I would recommend the Arabs. You start with Mysticism so you have a chance at grabbing lots of religions early and the philosophical trait should lead to quick great prophets to found the appropriate shrines. Call it the "Babylon" strategy after the villain in the "Left Behind" series who tries to conquer the world by founding a universal syncretistic religion. Commie Universalist Arabs take over the world! Oh My![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 2 = Distance-Based Maintenance[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][Update - the value established in this section is a minimum. Some undetermined factor can increase distance upkeep to more than this amount. Thanks to Requies for noticing this][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To test distance-based corruption, I created a horizontal line of 30 cities with the palace at one end and measured the distance-based component of maintenance for each one. The results are shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/horizdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It appears that on the settings used, the distance-based corruption is equal to the distance to the palace divided by 4.5, as long as the city in question is along a straight axis from the palace. I also tested distance along a diagonal distance and found that the diagonal distance does not obey Pythagoras' theorem. Instead it appears that the program counts diagonal distance as equaling 1.5 times the value of horizontal distance, rounded down. This makes sense as this was the method used to calculate distance in Civ3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/diagdist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Table: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/fulldist.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is great news because anyone who's ever done an RCP in vanilla Civ3 knows how to calculate rings on the map. There's even a utility to do it for you. The trick is to map out the rings of the appropriate distances (4,9,13,18,etc.) and place your cities inside those rings to avoid increasing distance upkeep. Pictured below is a formation that I'm naming the "Cheesy Circle"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/ironring.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ring of red X's shows the distance at which you start paying distance upkeep. This formation (when used on standard maps) gives you nine cities with no distance upkeep and 16 gpt in number-based upkeep, for less than 2 gpt/city. Each city can work over 12 tiles, which should be enough to exhaust their health and happiness anyway. Ideally, you spam settlers to build the circle (at minimal upkeep cost), then develop the cities into high-shield military bases for a classical-age swordsman rush.** The only drawback is that you may miss out on resources by having such a compact territory. In practice it may be best to put some of the cities into the 1-upkeep region to obtain much-needed special resources, such as iron.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]**This is a theoretical strategy at the moment. Next time I start a new game I'll try some variation of this layout. It would seem perfect for the first GOTM (Expansive leader, hill/grass/river start, great swordsman UU)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Test 3 - Do I have a life?[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No. But you don't either if you're still reading this.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In conclusion, city maintenance works more or less as advertised. The main headaches will come from having too many cities, but distance upkeep could potentially be annoying for small colonies in faraway lands. Consider carefully before founding a little city on a faraway continent for the sole purpose of claiming a banana resource, especially if you can get bananas by trading with your friends. Since many of the numbers are rounded, it is possible to take advantage of the system to minimize your city upkeep and play a more efficient game. I expect that some version of these calculations will figure in high-level civ4 play once there is such a thing as high-level civ4 play. Unless, of course, Firaxis decides to play with the formula in a patch or expansion, just like they did with ring city placement. Given their stated commitment to reducing the amount of math necessary to play the game, it is a likely possibility.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Please feel free to test and comment on my observations. They are as yet incomplete and any input is appreciated. I'll update once I figure out the answers to remaining questions, such as how upkeep works on different world sizes and what the formula for civic upkeep is.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Addendum - Courthouses and the upkeep limit[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to confirm the nature of the 6-upkeep limit for number of city upkeep, I placed 50 cities on a standard map and started filling them with courthouses. The courthouse affects the upkeep after the cap has been applied, so with courthouses in every city and state property, you should be able to pay only 3 gpt per city. While controlling all 7 holy cities and converting every city might be a pipe dream, doing this for 3-4 religions should be doable for would-be conquerors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Update - Difficulty level and City Upkeep[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After placing large numbers of cities in Warlord difficulty, it appears that difficulty level does affect upkeep. However, it does not affect the OCN. In warlord level, as in Monarch level, costs begin to accelerate after the tenth city. However, once the OCN is reached, costs increase at about 75% of the rate they do on Monarch. Since the OCN is unchanged, city placement shouldn't be that different on different difficulty levels, but it may be possible to squeeze a few more cities in at lower levels. A comparison is shown below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/monvswar.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also note that:[NEWLINE]Warlord maxes out at 5 gpt per city[NEWLINE]It takes longer for Warlord to max out city costs than Monarch. Thus there are actually certain points at which the next city costs more under Warlord, though the total upkeep is still less.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Civic Upkeep[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For this test, I started adding more and more size 1 cities and watching the additional civic upkeep for each one (F3). Preliminary tests indicate that on a standard map you start paying a flat fee for each size 1 city beyond the tenth. The amount comes to slightly less than 1 gpt per city for the starting civics. While it would be possible to catalogue rounding errors and exploit them the payoff would be very small and would need to take into account many possible combinations of city number, city size, and civic options, and would come to no more than 1 gpt anyway since civic upkeep, unlike distance upkeep, is one single lump sum rather than a bunch of small, separately rounded numbers.

		<English>[H1]Civic Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Roland Johansen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article is a joint contribution to this community by colony and Roland Johansen. We had some trouble getting the formulas in this article exactly right, but after correcting each other a few times, the correct formulas are now known. The article provides information for Civilization 4 versions 1.09 and 1.52 but mainly for version 1.52.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The article is divided in a few sections. The first section is a general introduction in the civic upkeep cost and probably contains no new information for most civilization 4 players. The second section explains how the game determines these costs. If you don't like mathematics and mathematical formulas, then you might want to skip this section and go on to the third section. The third section is about some strategic consequences of the way civilization 4 determines the civic upkeep cost. The fourth section gives some information to modders. It talks about the files where they can change the civic upkeep cost and about the consequences of adding more categories of civics. The last section mentions a utility created by Qitai that can calculate the civic upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Introduction[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost can be found in the financial advisor (F2) and in the change civics menu (F3), but the financial advisor is more useful to get a clear overview of the costs. If you mouse over the civic upkeep section of the financial advisor (F2), then the civic upkeep cost is broken down into the five well known sections: government, legal, labor, economy and religion. The upkeep cost of a civic is largely determined by its upkeep classification: no upkeep, low, medium or high. A low upkeep labor civic will cost about the same amount in upkeep as a low upkeep economy civic and a high upkeep government civic will cost about the same as a high upkeep religion civic. The change civics menu (F3) allows you to see the upkeep cost of another set of civics when you mouse over or select these civics. You can always cancel the revolution, so there's no risk in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a set of civics is chosen, then the upkeep cost is largely determined by the size of your empire: the number of cities in your empire (M) and the total size of your population (N). Also the organized trait (O) and the difficulty level (D) will have a large effect on the final upkeep cost. How the game determines the civic upkeep cost from these variables, can be found in the next section.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How the game calculates the civic upkeep cost[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost is dependent on some factors in the game. To make the description of the civic upkeep cost short and hopefully clear, a set of variables is introduced below.[NEWLINE]The upkeep of a civic is largely determined by its upkeep classification in the game (no upkeep, low, medium or high) in combination with the size of your empire. We denote the number of cities in your empire by M and the total size of your population by N (the sum of the population from all of your cities). The population modifier P determines the civic upkeep of running a civic of a certain upkeep classification in an empire of a certain population size (N). In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.05 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.10 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.15 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.08 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.12 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.16 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Likewise the number-of-cities modifier C dictates the civic upkeep cost of running a civic of a certain upkeep classification in an empire consisting of a certain number of cities (M). In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.2 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.5 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Last but not least are the effect of the organized trait, denoted by O and the effect of the difficulty level, denoted by D. The variable O is 1/2 if your civilization is organized and 1 if your civilization is not organized. The difficulty level modifier for the human player is 1 at deity, immortal or emperor level, 0.95 at monarch level, 0.9 at prince level, 0.8 at noble level, 0.7 at warlord level, 0.6 at chieftain level and finally 0.5 at settler level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty level modifier for the AI is 0.6 at deity level, 0.8 at immortal level, 0.85 at emperor level, 0.9 at monarch level, 0.95 at prince level and 1 at the levels below prince.[NEWLINE]It's a bit strange, but the civic upkeep cost is also dependent on the type of civic. A medium cost economy civic is close in upkeep to a medium cost government civic but not exactly the same. I think this was done to avoid the situation where one of your cities grows one unit in population or you build one additional city and suddenly all of your civics will rise in upkeep cost. Because of the small differences in the formulas, this will seldom happen. Take a look at the formulas below and you'll see that there are some minor differences:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Government civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-8) ] + [ C * (M-1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Legal civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-9) ] + [ C * M ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Labor civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-10) ] + [ C * (M+1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Economy civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-11) ] + [ C * (M+2) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Religion civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-12) ] + [ C * (M+3) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Terms between brackets [....] are to be rounded down. So there is a lot of rounding down in these formulas. Note that there is a clear pattern in these formulas, but to keep the format of the formulas somewhat readable, the formulas were presented independently and not in one big formula.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course, the total upkeep cost for civics is determined by adding the costs of all of the chosen civics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example (for civilization 4 version 1.52):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are playing a game at Noble difficulty level and own 11 cities of sizes: 9, 7, 12, 8, 15, 14, 12, 11, 11, 15 and 14. So your total population is 128. You're running the civics representation, bureaucracy, serfdom, decentralization and organized religion. Your leader has the organized trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then according to the formulas, the upkeep cost for representation (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-8) ] + [0.4 * (11-1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for bureaucracy (medium upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.12 * (128-9) ] + [0.5 * 11 ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (14 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 9] = 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for serfdom (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-10) ] + [0.4 * (11 +1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for decentralization (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-11) ] + [0.4 * (11 +2) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 7] = 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for organized religion (high upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.16 * (128-12) ] + [0.6 * (11 +3) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (18 + 8) ] ] = [0.8 * 13] = 10.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And thus the total civic upkeep is: 4+7+4+5+10=30.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some repercussions of the way the game calculates the civic upkeep (for civilization 4 version 1.52)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The above formulas are all nice and such, but nobody is really going to use them when playing a game of civilization 4. But they can offer a deeper insight into the workings of the game. This might help you play the game a little better or help create a nice balanced mod for the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The no upkeep classification is a pretty big advantage for a civic. The difference in upkeep between no upkeep and low upkeep is larger than the difference between low upkeep and high upkeep. Especially in empires with lots of large cities, the no upkeep classification is very powerful.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In empires with small cities, the differences in upkeep classification don't mean very much (with exception of the above noted no upkeep classification). In empires with large cities, the high upkeep civics cost almost twice as much as the low upkeep civics. The medium upkeep civics have a cost halfway the low and high upkeep civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Because the civic upkeep is higher at the higher difficulty levels, the organized trait is a more interesting trait at these higher difficulty levels. You can already notice this right from the start of the game. Normally at the highest difficulty levels, you can not set your research slider at 100%. But if you start with the organized trait, you can research at 100% getting those first few technologies a bit sooner. Later in the game, you will probably also be able to set the research slider at a higher rate thanks to the reduced cost of civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Civic upkeep limits fast expansion. When you start developing your empire, then your cities tend to be small and don't make a lot of money. Still a lot of small cities tend to cost a considerable amount in civic upkeep. When the cities grow, the civic upkeep also grows, but not as fast as the commerce production of well developed cities. A city of size 10 will produce far more commerce than a city of size 1 (say 5-20 times as much, depending on how well it is developed), but it will cost less than 3 times as much in civic upkeep. Clearly large cities can cope with civic upkeep cost better than small cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The organized trait has an effect that tends to be a bit larger than halving the civic upkeep, especially at the beginning of the game when the civic upkeep is still low (the reason is the rounding down in the formulas). This can make this trait very interesting for warmongers who tend to get lots of small cities early in the game. The low commerce production of these cities combined with a high upkeep, high civic upkeep and high unit upkeep can spell disaster for warmongers who are a bit too successful in their wars.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The civic upkeep for human players is lower than the civic upkeep for AI's at the levels settler, chieftain, warlord, noble and prince. So while the AI has some advantages at noble level, it also has some disadvantages.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Inflation is a percentage that adds to all types of costs and rises uncontrollably throughout the game. Because inflation can rise as high as 100%, the costs of civics can be doubled in the late game. This might make you rethink using those expensive civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Free unit support also grows with population size. So while the cost of maintaining your civics grows when your cities grow, the free support for your units also grows. This means that a growing empire's expenditures don't necessarily increase that fast. If your leader is organized and you're running low cost civics, then the effect of the increase in free unit support could even be greater then the effect of the increase in civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A rule of thumb for the costs of running the lowest cost civics, the highest cost civics and an average cost example. This can be useful to estimate the profitability of a city in the long run before you even found it. You can estimate the amount of cottages needed to make a single city a profitable entity. Of course, not every city has to pay for itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the lowest possible cost (2 low cost civics and 3 no cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.16 gold for each point of population and 0.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the highest cost (3 high cost civics and 2 medium cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.72 gold for each point of population and 2.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use my favorite civics (universal suffrage, free speech, emancipation, state property and organized religion) which have an average cost, then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.44 gold for each point of population and 1.9 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that these costs are reduced at the lower difficulty levels and are halved by the organized trait. Also note that the inflation percentage can increase the costs considerably and almost double these costs in the late game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some information for modders[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I guess most people who mod civ4 will find the files by themselves. Still, these files were useful to find some numbers and might as well be mentioned. The modifiers for difficulty level are of course in the file CIV4HandicapInfo.xml named iCivicUpkeepPercent for human players and iAICivicUpkeepPercent for AI's. In the file CIV4UpKeepInfo.xml, the numbers can be found that determine the effects of low, medium and high upkeep costs. In the file CIV4CivicInfos.xml, the upkeep classifications (no upkeep, low, medium, high), can be set for each civic. Also every other effect of civics can be changed in that file.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If more categories of civics are added, then it can be expected that the formulas that determine civic upkeep costs will follow the same pattern. So a sixth category of civics will probably have the following upkeep costs:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-13) ] + [ C * (M+4) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Utility for calculating civic upkeep costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qitai has created an excel spreadsheet (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=3776573&amp;postcount=24) which can calculate the civic upkeep cost for you. It can be used to see how civic upkeep cost will develop while you expand your empire. Thanks Qitai!</English>

In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.05 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.10 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.15 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.08 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.12 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.16 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Likewise the number-of-cities modifier C dictates the civic upkeep cost of running a civic of a certain upkeep classification in an empire consisting of a certain number of cities (M). In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.2 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.5 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Last but not least are the effect of the organized trait, denoted by O and the effect of the difficulty level, denoted by D. The variable O is 1/2 if your civilization is organized and 1 if your civilization is not organized. The difficulty level modifier for the human player is 1 at deity, immortal or emperor level, 0.95 at monarch level, 0.9 at prince level, 0.8 at noble level, 0.7 at warlord level, 0.6 at chieftain level and finally 0.5 at settler level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty level modifier for the AI is 0.6 at deity level, 0.8 at immortal level, 0.85 at emperor level, 0.9 at monarch level, 0.95 at prince level and 1 at the levels below prince.[NEWLINE]It's a bit strange, but the civic upkeep cost is also dependent on the type of civic. A medium cost economy civic is close in upkeep to a medium cost government civic but not exactly the same. I think this was done to avoid the situation where one of your cities grows one unit in population or you build one additional city and suddenly all of your civics will rise in upkeep cost. Because of the small differences in the formulas, this will seldom happen. Take a look at the formulas below and you'll see that there are some minor differences:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Government civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-8) ] + [ C * (M-1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Legal civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-9) ] + [ C * M ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Labor civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-10) ] + [ C * (M+1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Economy civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-11) ] + [ C * (M+2) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Religion civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-12) ] + [ C * (M+3) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Terms between brackets [....] are to be rounded down. So there is a lot of rounding down in these formulas. Note that there is a clear pattern in these formulas, but to keep the format of the formulas somewhat readable, the formulas were presented independently and not in one big formula.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course, the total upkeep cost for civics is determined by adding the costs of all of the chosen civics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example (for civilization 4 version 1.52):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are playing a game at Noble difficulty level and own 11 cities of sizes: 9, 7, 12, 8, 15, 14, 12, 11, 11, 15 and 14. So your total population is 128. You're running the civics representation, bureaucracy, serfdom, decentralization and organized religion. Your leader has the organized trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then according to the formulas, the upkeep cost for representation (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-8) ] + [0.4 * (11-1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for bureaucracy (medium upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.12 * (128-9) ] + [0.5 * 11 ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (14 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 9] = 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for serfdom (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-10) ] + [0.4 * (11 +1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for decentralization (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-11) ] + [0.4 * (11 +2) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 7] = 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for organized religion (high upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.16 * (128-12) ] + [0.6 * (11 +3) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (18 + 8) ] ] = [0.8 * 13] = 10.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And thus the total civic upkeep is: 4+7+4+5+10=30.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some repercussions of the way the game calculates the civic upkeep (for civilization 4 version 1.52)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The above formulas are all nice and such, but nobody is really going to use them when playing a game of civilization 4. But they can offer a deeper insight into the workings of the game. This might help you play the game a little better or help create a nice balanced mod for the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The no upkeep classification is a pretty big advantage for a civic. The difference in upkeep between no upkeep and low upkeep is larger than the difference between low upkeep and high upkeep. Especially in empires with lots of large cities, the no upkeep classification is very powerful.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In empires with small cities, the differences in upkeep classification don't mean very much (with exception of the above noted no upkeep classification). In empires with large cities, the high upkeep civics cost almost twice as much as the low upkeep civics. The medium upkeep civics have a cost halfway the low and high upkeep civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Because the civic upkeep is higher at the higher difficulty levels, the organized trait is a more interesting trait at these higher difficulty levels. You can already notice this right from the start of the game. Normally at the highest difficulty levels, you can not set your research slider at 100%. But if you start with the organized trait, you can research at 100% getting those first few technologies a bit sooner. Later in the game, you will probably also be able to set the research slider at a higher rate thanks to the reduced cost of civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Civic upkeep limits fast expansion. When you start developing your empire, then your cities tend to be small and don't make a lot of money. Still a lot of small cities tend to cost a considerable amount in civic upkeep. When the cities grow, the civic upkeep also grows, but not as fast as the commerce production of well developed cities. A city of size 10 will produce far more commerce than a city of size 1 (say 5-20 times as much, depending on how well it is developed), but it will cost less than 3 times as much in civic upkeep. Clearly large cities can cope with civic upkeep cost better than small cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The organized trait has an effect that tends to be a bit larger than halving the civic upkeep, especially at the beginning of the game when the civic upkeep is still low (the reason is the rounding down in the formulas). This can make this trait very interesting for warmongers who tend to get lots of small cities early in the game. The low commerce production of these cities combined with a high upkeep, high civic upkeep and high unit upkeep can spell disaster for warmongers who are a bit too successful in their wars.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The civic upkeep for human players is lower than the civic upkeep for AI's at the levels settler, chieftain, warlord, noble and prince. So while the AI has some advantages at noble level, it also has some disadvantages.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Inflation is a percentage that adds to all types of costs and rises uncontrollably throughout the game. Because inflation can rise as high as 100%, the costs of civics can be doubled in the late game. This might make you rethink using those expensive civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Free unit support also grows with population size. So while the cost of maintaining your civics grows when your cities grow, the free support for your units also grows. This means that a growing empire's expenditures don't necessarily increase that fast. If your leader is organized and you're running low cost civics, then the effect of the increase in free unit support could even be greater then the effect of the increase in civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A rule of thumb for the costs of running the lowest cost civics, the highest cost civics and an average cost example. This can be useful to estimate the profitability of a city in the long run before you even found it. You can estimate the amount of cottages needed to make a single city a profitable entity. Of course, not every city has to pay for itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the lowest possible cost (2 low cost civics and 3 no cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.16 gold for each point of population and 0.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the highest cost (3 high cost civics and 2 medium cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.72 gold for each point of population and 2.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use my favorite civics (universal suffrage, free speech, emancipation, state property and organized religion) which have an average cost, then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.44 gold for each point of population and 1.9 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that these costs are reduced at the lower difficulty levels and are halved by the organized trait. Also note that the inflation percentage can increase the costs considerably and almost double these costs in the late game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some information for modders[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I guess most people who mod civ4 will find the files by themselves. Still, these files were useful to find some numbers and might as well be mentioned. The modifiers for difficulty level are of course in the file CIV4HandicapInfo.xml named iCivicUpkeepPercent for human players and iAICivicUpkeepPercent for AI's. In the file CIV4UpKeepInfo.xml, the numbers can be found that determine the effects of low, medium and high upkeep costs. In the file CIV4CivicInfos.xml, the upkeep classifications (no upkeep, low, medium, high), can be set for each civic. Also every other effect of civics can be changed in that file.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If more categories of civics are added, then it can be expected that the formulas that determine civic upkeep costs will follow the same pattern. So a sixth category of civics will probably have the following upkeep costs:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-13) ] + [ C * (M+4) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Utility for calculating civic upkeep costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qitai has created an excel spreadsheet (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=3776573&amp;postcount=24) which can calculate the civic upkeep cost for you. It can be used to see how civic upkeep cost will develop while you expand your empire. Thanks Qitai!</French>
		<German>[H1]Civic Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Roland Johansen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article is a joint contribution to this community by colony and Roland Johansen. We had some trouble getting the formulas in this article exactly right, but after correcting each other a few times, the correct formulas are now known. The article provides information for Civilization 4 versions 1.09 and 1.52 but mainly for version 1.52.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The article is divided in a few sections. The first section is a general introduction in the civic upkeep cost and probably contains no new information for most civilization 4 players. The second section explains how the game determines these costs. If you don't like mathematics and mathematical formulas, then you might want to skip this section and go on to the third section. The third section is about some strategic consequences of the way civilization 4 determines the civic upkeep cost. The fourth section gives some information to modders. It talks about the files where they can change the civic upkeep cost and about the consequences of adding more categories of civics. The last section mentions a utility created by Qitai that can calculate the civic upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Introduction[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost can be found in the financial advisor (F2) and in the change civics menu (F3), but the financial advisor is more useful to get a clear overview of the costs. If you mouse over the civic upkeep section of the financial advisor (F2), then the civic upkeep cost is broken down into the five well known sections: government, legal, labor, economy and religion. The upkeep cost of a civic is largely determined by its upkeep classification: no upkeep, low, medium or high. A low upkeep labor civic will cost about the same amount in upkeep as a low upkeep economy civic and a high upkeep government civic will cost about the same as a high upkeep religion civic. The change civics menu (F3) allows you to see the upkeep cost of another set of civics when you mouse over or select these civics. You can always cancel the revolution, so there's no risk in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a set of civics is chosen, then the upkeep cost is largely determined by the size of your empire: the number of cities in your empire (M) and the total size of your population (N). Also the organized trait (O) and the difficulty level (D) will have a large effect on the final upkeep cost. How the game determines the civic upkeep cost from these variables, can be found in the next section.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How the game calculates the civic upkeep cost[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost is dependent on some factors in the game.

In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.5 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Last but not least are the effect of the organized trait, denoted by O and the effect of the difficulty level, denoted by D. The variable O is 1/2 if your civilization is organized and 1 if your civilization is not organized. The difficulty level modifier for the human player is 1 at deity, immortal or emperor level, 0.95 at monarch level, 0.9 at prince level, 0.8 at noble level, 0.7 at warlord level, 0.6 at chieftain level and finally 0.5 at settler level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty level modifier for the AI is 0.6 at deity level, 0.8 at immortal level, 0.85 at emperor level, 0.9 at monarch level, 0.95 at prince level and 1 at the levels below prince.[NEWLINE]It's a bit strange, but the civic upkeep cost is also dependent on the type of civic. A medium cost economy civic is close in upkeep to a medium cost government civic but not exactly the same. I think this was done to avoid the situation where one of your cities grows one unit in population or you build one additional city and suddenly all of your civics will rise in upkeep cost. Because of the small differences in the formulas, this will seldom happen. Take a look at the formulas below and you'll see that there are some minor differences:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Government civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-8) ] + [ C * (M-1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Legal civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-9) ] + [ C * M ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Labor civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-10) ] + [ C * (M+1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Economy civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-11) ] + [ C * (M+2) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Religion civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-12) ] + [ C * (M+3) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Terms between brackets [....] are to be rounded down. So there is a lot of rounding down in these formulas. Note that there is a clear pattern in these formulas, but to keep the format of the formulas somewhat readable, the formulas were presented independently and not in one big formula.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course, the total upkeep cost for civics is determined by adding the costs of all of the chosen civics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example (for civilization 4 version 1.52):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are playing a game at Noble difficulty level and own 11 cities of sizes: 9, 7, 12, 8, 15, 14, 12, 11, 11, 15 and 14. So your total population is 128. You're running the civics representation, bureaucracy, serfdom, decentralization and organized religion. Your leader has the organized trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then according to the formulas, the upkeep cost for representation (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-8) ] + [0.4 * (11-1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for bureaucracy (medium upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.12 * (128-9) ] + [0.5 * 11 ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (14 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 9] = 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for serfdom (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-10) ] + [0.4 * (11 +1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for decentralization (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-11) ] + [0.4 * (11 +2) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 7] = 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for organized religion (high upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.16 * (128-12) ] + [0.6 * (11 +3) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (18 + 8) ] ] = [0.8 * 13] = 10.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And thus the total civic upkeep is: 4+7+4+5+10=30.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some repercussions of the way the game calculates the civic upkeep (for civilization 4 version 1.52)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The above formulas are all nice and such, but nobody is really going to use them when playing a game of civilization 4. But they can offer a deeper insight into the workings of the game. This might help you play the game a little better or help create a nice balanced mod for the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The no upkeep classification is a pretty big advantage for a civic. The difference in upkeep between no upkeep and low upkeep is larger than the difference between low upkeep and high upkeep. Especially in empires with lots of large cities, the no upkeep classification is very powerful.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In empires with small cities, the differences in upkeep classification don't mean very much (with exception of the above noted no upkeep classification). In empires with large cities, the high upkeep civics cost almost twice as much as the low upkeep civics. The medium upkeep civics have a cost halfway the low and high upkeep civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Because the civic upkeep is higher at the higher difficulty levels, the organized trait is a more interesting trait at these higher difficulty levels. You can already notice this right from the start of the game. Normally at the highest difficulty levels, you can not set your research slider at 100%. But if you start with the organized trait, you can research at 100% getting those first few technologies a bit sooner. Later in the game, you will probably also be able to set the research slider at a higher rate thanks to the reduced cost of civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Civic upkeep limits fast expansion. When you start developing your empire, then your cities tend to be small and don't make a lot of money. Still a lot of small cities tend to cost a considerable amount in civic upkeep. When the cities grow, the civic upkeep also grows, but not as fast as the commerce production of well developed cities. A city of size 10 will produce far more commerce than a city of size 1 (say 5-20 times as much, depending on how well it is developed), but it will cost less than 3 times as much in civic upkeep. Clearly large cities can cope with civic upkeep cost better than small cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The organized trait has an effect that tends to be a bit larger than halving the civic upkeep, especially at the beginning of the game when the civic upkeep is still low (the reason is the rounding down in the formulas). This can make this trait very interesting for warmongers who tend to get lots of small cities early in the game. The low commerce production of these cities combined with a high upkeep, high civic upkeep and high unit upkeep can spell disaster for warmongers who are a bit too successful in their wars.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The civic upkeep for human players is lower than the civic upkeep for AI's at the levels settler, chieftain, warlord, noble and prince. So while the AI has some advantages at noble level, it also has some disadvantages.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Inflation is a percentage that adds to all types of costs and rises uncontrollably throughout the game. Because inflation can rise as high as 100%, the costs of civics can be doubled in the late game. This might make you rethink using those expensive civics.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Free unit support also grows with population size. So while the cost of maintaining your civics grows when your cities grow, the free support for your units also grows. This means that a growing empire's expenditures don't necessarily increase that fast. If your leader is organized and you're running low cost civics, then the effect of the increase in free unit support could even be greater then the effect of the increase in civic upkeep.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A rule of thumb for the costs of running the lowest cost civics, the highest cost civics and an average cost example. This can be useful to estimate the profitability of a city in the long run before you even found it. You can estimate the amount of cottages needed to make a single city a profitable entity. Of course, not every city has to pay for itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the lowest possible cost (2 low cost civics and 3 no cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.16 gold for each point of population and 0.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use the civics in the game with the highest cost (3 high cost civics and 2 medium cost civics), then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.72 gold for each point of population and 2.8 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you use my favorite civics (universal suffrage, free speech, emancipation, state property and organized religion) which have an average cost, then the civic upkeep cost will be 0.44 gold for each point of population and 1.9 gold for each city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that these costs are reduced at the lower difficulty levels and are halved by the organized trait. Also note that the inflation percentage can increase the costs considerably and almost double these costs in the late game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some information for modders[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I guess most people who mod civ4 will find the files by themselves. Still, these files were useful to find some numbers and might as well be mentioned. The modifiers for difficulty level are of course in the file CIV4HandicapInfo.xml named iCivicUpkeepPercent for human players and iAICivicUpkeepPercent for AI's. In the file CIV4UpKeepInfo.xml, the numbers can be found that determine the effects of low, medium and high upkeep costs. In the file CIV4CivicInfos.xml, the upkeep classifications (no upkeep, low, medium, high), can be set for each civic. Also every other effect of civics can be changed in that file.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If more categories of civics are added, then it can be expected that the formulas that determine civic upkeep costs will follow the same pattern. So a sixth category of civics will probably have the following upkeep costs:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-13) ] + [ C * (M+4) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Utility for calculating civic upkeep costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qitai has created an excel spreadsheet (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=3776573&amp;postcount=24) which can calculate the civic upkeep cost for you. It can be used to see how civic upkeep cost will develop while you expand your empire. Thanks Qitai!</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Civic Upkeep Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Roland Johansen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article is a joint contribution to this community by colony and Roland Johansen. We had some trouble getting the formulas in this article exactly right, but after correcting each other a few times, the correct formulas are now known. The article provides information for Civilization 4 versions 1.09 and 1.52 but mainly for version 1.52.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The article is divided in a few sections. The first section is a general introduction in the civic upkeep cost and probably contains no new information for most civilization 4 players. The second section explains how the game determines these costs. If you don't like mathematics and mathematical formulas, then you might want to skip this section and go on to the third section. The third section is about some strategic consequences of the way civilization 4 determines the civic upkeep cost. The fourth section gives some information to modders. It talks about the files where they can change the civic upkeep cost and about the consequences of adding more categories of civics. The last section mentions a utility created by Qitai that can calculate the civic upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Introduction[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost can be found in the financial advisor (F2) and in the change civics menu (F3), but the financial advisor is more useful to get a clear overview of the costs. If you mouse over the civic upkeep section of the financial advisor (F2), then the civic upkeep cost is broken down into the five well known sections: government, legal, labor, economy and religion. The upkeep cost of a civic is largely determined by its upkeep classification: no upkeep, low, medium or high. A low upkeep labor civic will cost about the same amount in upkeep as a low upkeep economy civic and a high upkeep government civic will cost about the same as a high upkeep religion civic. The change civics menu (F3) allows you to see the upkeep cost of another set of civics when you mouse over or select these civics. You can always cancel the revolution, so there's no risk in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a set of civics is chosen, then the upkeep cost is largely determined by the size of your empire: the number of cities in your empire (M) and the total size of your population (N). Also the organized trait (O) and the difficulty level (D) will have a large effect on the final upkeep cost. How the game determines the civic upkeep cost from these variables, can be found in the next section.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]How the game calculates the civic upkeep cost[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The civic upkeep cost is dependent on some factors in the game. To make the description of the civic upkeep cost short and hopefully clear, a set of variables is introduced below.[NEWLINE]The upkeep of a civic is largely determined by its upkeep classification in the game (no upkeep, low, medium or high) in combination with the size of your empire. We denote the number of cities in your empire by M and the total size of your population by N (the sum of the population from all of your cities). The population modifier P determines the civic upkeep of running a civic of a certain upkeep classification in an empire of a certain population size (N). In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.05 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.10 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.15 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable P is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.08 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.12 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.16 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Likewise the number-of-cities modifier C dictates the civic upkeep cost of running a civic of a certain upkeep classification in an empire consisting of a certain number of cities (M). In civilization 4 version 1.09, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.2 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost. In civilization 4 version 1.52, the variable C is equal to 0 for civics with no upkeep cost, 0.4 for civics with low upkeep cost, 0.5 for civics with medium upkeep cost and 0.6 for civics with high upkeep cost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Last but not least are the effect of the organized trait, denoted by O and the effect of the difficulty level, denoted by D. The variable O is 1/2 if your civilization is organized and 1 if your civilization is not organized. The difficulty level modifier for the human player is 1 at deity, immortal or emperor level, 0.95 at monarch level, 0.9 at prince level, 0.8 at noble level, 0.7 at warlord level, 0.6 at chieftain level and finally 0.5 at settler level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The difficulty level modifier for the AI is 0.6 at deity level, 0.8 at immortal level, 0.85 at emperor level, 0.9 at monarch level, 0.95 at prince level and 1 at the levels below prince.[NEWLINE]It's a bit strange, but the civic upkeep cost is also dependent on the type of civic. A medium cost economy civic is close in upkeep to a medium cost government civic but not exactly the same. I think this was done to avoid the situation where one of your cities grows one unit in population or you build one additional city and suddenly all of your civics will rise in upkeep cost. Because of the small differences in the formulas, this will seldom happen. Take a look at the formulas below and you'll see that there are some minor differences:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Government civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-8) ] + [ C * (M-1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Legal civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-9) ] + [ C * M ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Labor civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-10) ] + [ C * (M+1) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Economy civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-11) ] + [ C * (M+2) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE]Religion civics upkeep:[NEWLINE][D * [ O * ( [ P * (N-12) ] + [ C * (M+3) ] ) ] ][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Terms between brackets [....] are to be rounded down. So there is a lot of rounding down in these formulas. Note that there is a clear pattern in these formulas, but to keep the format of the formulas somewhat readable, the formulas were presented independently and not in one big formula.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course, the total upkeep cost for civics is determined by adding the costs of all of the chosen civics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An example (for civilization 4 version 1.52):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are playing a game at Noble difficulty level and own 11 cities of sizes: 9, 7, 12, 8, 15, 14, 12, 11, 11, 15 and 14.

Your leader has the organized trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then according to the formulas, the upkeep cost for representation (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-8) ] + [0.4 * (11-1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for bureaucracy (medium upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.12 * (128-9) ] + [0.5 * 11 ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (14 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 9] = 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for serfdom (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-10) ] + [0.4 * (11 +1) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 4) ] ] = [0.8 * 6] = 4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for decentralization (low upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.08 * (128-11) ] + [0.4 * (11 +2) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (9 + 5) ] ] = [0.8 * 7] = 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The upkeep cost for organized religion (high upkeep) is:[NEWLINE][0.8 * [ 0.5 * ( [ 0.16 * (128-12) ] + [0.6 * (11 +3) ] ) ] ] = [0.8 * [ 0.5 * (18 + 8) ] ] = [0.8 * 13] = 10.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And thus the total civic upkeep is: 4+7+4+5+10=30.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Some repercussions of the way the game calculates the civic upkeep (for civilization 4 version 1.52)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The above formulas are all nice and such, but nobody is really going to use them when playing a game of civilization 4.

After reading this article, you should fully understand the different elements of Corporate Maintenance and how to fully calculate its impact on any of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So here we go ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Table of Contents (this article's pretty long)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Basics: Some Definitions[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The Formula[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An Example[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A Comparison Using The Example[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Some Conclusions &amp; Thoughts On Corporate Management[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Other Articles[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In Closing[NEWLINE]([ICON_BULLET]The Cost of Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Basics: Some Definitions (see the Civilopedia also)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following definitions represent a brief introduction to some of the different relevant Corporate elements I may refer to during this post.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]To reduce the length of this post and get you to the part you probably came for quicker and more easily, I've hidden the definitions in spoiler tags. If you're already familiar with Corporations, you may wish to skip this section.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporations[COLOR_REVERT]. There are seven Corporations in BtS. Once you have both the "Corporation" technology (thanks to oedali for the reminder) and the technology enabling the particular Corporation's founding, you may found that Corporation by expending a Great Person to build its Corporate Headquarters building in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Corporations provide benefits to cities they are spread to in exchange for Corporate Fees, which manifest as City Maintenance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though I won't be going into detail about Resource Consumption and Corporate Competition, it is important to note that a Corporation cannot be founded in or spread to a city without access to any of its consumed resources and can never be founded in a city where a competitor's Corporate Headquarters is already present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Headquarters[COLOR_REVERT]. Every Corporation has only one Headquarters building -- present only in the city in which the Corporation was founded. Only a Great Person can build a Corporate Headquarters (and thus found the Corporation) and is consumed in doing so. The Corporate Headquarters also indicates the presence of the Corporation and thus provides the Corporation's benefits and incurs the appropriate Corporate Fees. The primary benefit of a Corporate Headquarters is that it generates +4 [ICON_GOLD] for every city with one of its Corporate Offices (i.e, that the Corporation has spread to).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It's worth noting a Corporate Headquarters building [BOLD]can only be built once[\BOLD]. If the Corporate Headquarters is destroyed, it is lost forever. To the best of my knowledge, the Corporate Headquarters can only be destroyed if the city it's in is conquered and razed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Office[COLOR_REVERT]. The presence of a Corporate Office in a city indicates the represented Corporation is present in the city. Thus, that city will incur the appropriate Corporate Fees in exchange for the Corporation's benefits. The Corporate Headquarters doubles as a Corporate Office.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporation[COLOR_REVERT]. A Foreign Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is not present in one of your cities (i.e., is not controlled by your civilization). A Domestic Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is present in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporate Office.[COLOR_REVERT] A Foreign Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in a foreign city -- regardless of whether it represents a Foreign or Domestic Corporation.

Once you have both the "Corporation" technology (thanks to oedali for the reminder) and the technology enabling the particular Corporation's founding, you may found that Corporation by expending a Great Person to build its Corporate Headquarters building in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Corporations provide benefits to cities they are spread to in exchange for Corporate Fees, which manifest as City Maintenance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though I won't be going into detail about Resource Consumption and Corporate Competition, it is important to note that a Corporation cannot be founded in or spread to a city without access to any of its consumed resources and can never be founded in a city where a competitor's Corporate Headquarters is already present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Headquarters[COLOR_REVERT]. Every Corporation has only one Headquarters building -- present only in the city in which the Corporation was founded. Only a Great Person can build a Corporate Headquarters (and thus found the Corporation) and is consumed in doing so. The Corporate Headquarters also indicates the presence of the Corporation and thus provides the Corporation's benefits and incurs the appropriate Corporate Fees. The primary benefit of a Corporate Headquarters is that it generates +4 [ICON_GOLD] for every city with one of its Corporate Offices (i.e, that the Corporation has spread to).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It's worth noting a Corporate Headquarters building [BOLD]can only be built once[\BOLD]. If the Corporate Headquarters is destroyed, it is lost forever. To the best of my knowledge, the Corporate Headquarters can only be destroyed if the city it's in is conquered and razed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Office[COLOR_REVERT]. The presence of a Corporate Office in a city indicates the represented Corporation is present in the city. Thus, that city will incur the appropriate Corporate Fees in exchange for the Corporation's benefits. The Corporate Headquarters doubles as a Corporate Office.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporation[COLOR_REVERT]. A Foreign Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is not present in one of your cities (i.e., is not controlled by your civilization). A Domestic Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is present in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporate Office.[COLOR_REVERT] A Foreign Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in a foreign city -- regardless of whether it represents a Foreign or Domestic Corporation. Likewise, a Domestic Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in one of your cities -- even if the Corporate Headquarters is controlled by a foreign power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The distinction between "foreign" and "domestic" is especially important when discussing the effects of the Mercantilism and State Property Civics later on.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Executive[COLOR_REVERT]. Corporations are spread by Corporate Executives. These units can only be built in a city where the Corporation's Headquarters or Office is present. A Corporate Executive can only spread the Corporation he represents to one city and is consumed in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that expanding a Corporation (spreading it) requires an initial 'investment', which is deducted from your treasury at the time of expansion. It is also worth noting that foreign expansion and expanding a Corporation to a city where one of its competitors' Corporate Offices is already present both increase the initial cost of expansion. ([BOLD]The Cost of Expansion[\BOLD]: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6106402#Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Free Market[COLOR_REVERT]. The Free Market Civic reduces Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Free Market is that its reduction is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this reduction comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Environmentalism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Environmentalism Civic increases Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Environmentalism is that its increase is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this increase comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Mercantilism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Mercantilism Civic negates the effects of all [BOLD]Foreign[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. Any Foreign Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Foreign Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the Mercantilism Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of Mercantilism:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Domestic Corporations cannot be founded (this is popularly viewed as a bug and is fixed in Bhruic's Unofficial BtS 3.13 patch: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6019403#post6019403).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]You do not have to buyout Foreign Corporate Offices when spreading Domestic Corporations. (thanks to jkp1187 for the reminder.)[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train a Corporate Executive for any Foreign Corporation.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporate Headquarters do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]State Property[COLOR_REVERT]. The State Property Civic negates the effects of [BOLD]all[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. All Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the State Property Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of State Property:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives. ([BOLD]This includes founding Domestic Corporations.[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train any Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporate Headquarters (both foreign and domestic) do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your Domestic Corporate Headquarters continue to gain +4 gold for every one of your Foreign Corporate Offices not under the Mercantilism or State Property Civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]City Improvements (Buildings)[COLOR_REVERT]. All Corporate Fees and benefits are raw yield values. This is important, because any buildings which reduce maintenance (i.e., Courthouse, Rathaus, etc.) or increase tile/specialist yields (i.e., Library, Forge, Wall Street, etc.) apply their appropriate affects to the Corporations' Fees or Benefits -- thus decreasing its impact and increasing its yield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Inflation[COLOR_REVERT]. Inflation is the last calculation applied to any Corporate Fees and is thus after all other factors are weighed. However, as of BtS patch 3.13, there is an additional factor applied during the calculation of the Corporate Fees which serves to reduce Corporate Fees and negate inflation. So, the most important thing to note is that [BOLD]inflation has no net effect on Corporate Maintenance in 3.13.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain.[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bear with me through this next section, because this one has all the math. A couple things to note first:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]a. Each city calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other cities in your empire.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]b. Each Corporate Office calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other Corporate Offices in the same city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]c. All Corporate Offices calculate their Corporate Fees identically (can be changed via the variable &lt;iMaintenance&gt; in CIV4CorporationInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are seven factors which determine a Corporate Office's Fees. These only take affect if a Corporation is consuming one or more resources in the city. (I.e, a Corporate Office denied access to the appropriate resources generates no fees but still provides +4 gold to its Corporate Headquarters):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Base Rate[COLOR_REVERT].

And with Universities &amp; Banks and especially with Wall Street &amp; Oxford University, you can increase the net value from any commerce tiles or specialists yields to soaring heights. (And don't forget about Representation, Free Speech/Bureaucracy and the Financial trait.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let's also keep in mind that +food can be used however you want.

After reading this article, you should fully understand the different elements of Corporate Maintenance and how to fully calculate its impact on any of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So here we go ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Table of Contents (this article's pretty long)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Basics: Some Definitions[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The Formula[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An Example[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A Comparison Using The Example[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Some Conclusions &amp; Thoughts On Corporate Management[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Other Articles[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In Closing[NEWLINE]([ICON_BULLET]The Cost of Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Basics: Some Definitions (see the Civilopedia also)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following definitions represent a brief introduction to some of the different relevant Corporate elements I may refer to during this post.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]To reduce the length of this post and get you to the part you probably came for quicker and more easily, I've hidden the definitions in spoiler tags. If you're already familiar with Corporations, you may wish to skip this section.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporations[COLOR_REVERT]. There are seven Corporations in BtS. Once you have both the "Corporation" technology (thanks to oedali for the reminder) and the technology enabling the particular Corporation's founding, you may found that Corporation by expending a Great Person to build its Corporate Headquarters building in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Corporations provide benefits to cities they are spread to in exchange for Corporate Fees, which manifest as City Maintenance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though I won't be going into detail about Resource Consumption and Corporate Competition, it is important to note that a Corporation cannot be founded in or spread to a city without access to any of its consumed resources and can never be founded in a city where a competitor's Corporate Headquarters is already present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Headquarters[COLOR_REVERT]. Every Corporation has only one Headquarters building -- present only in the city in which the Corporation was founded. Only a Great Person can build a Corporate Headquarters (and thus found the Corporation) and is consumed in doing so. The Corporate Headquarters also indicates the presence of the Corporation and thus provides the Corporation's benefits and incurs the appropriate Corporate Fees. The primary benefit of a Corporate Headquarters is that it generates +4 [ICON_GOLD] for every city with one of its Corporate Offices (i.e, that the Corporation has spread to).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It's worth noting a Corporate Headquarters building [BOLD]can only be built once[\BOLD]. If the Corporate Headquarters is destroyed, it is lost forever. To the best of my knowledge, the Corporate Headquarters can only be destroyed if the city it's in is conquered and razed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Office[COLOR_REVERT]. The presence of a Corporate Office in a city indicates the represented Corporation is present in the city. Thus, that city will incur the appropriate Corporate Fees in exchange for the Corporation's benefits. The Corporate Headquarters doubles as a Corporate Office.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporation[COLOR_REVERT]. A Foreign Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is not present in one of your cities (i.e., is not controlled by your civilization). A Domestic Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is present in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporate Office.[COLOR_REVERT] A Foreign Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in a foreign city -- regardless of whether it represents a Foreign or Domestic Corporation. Likewise, a Domestic Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in one of your cities -- even if the Corporate Headquarters is controlled by a foreign power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The distinction between "foreign" and "domestic" is especially important when discussing the effects of the Mercantilism and State Property Civics later on.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Executive[COLOR_REVERT]. Corporations are spread by Corporate Executives. These units can only be built in a city where the Corporation's Headquarters or Office is present. A Corporate Executive can only spread the Corporation he represents to one city and is consumed in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that expanding a Corporation (spreading it) requires an initial 'investment', which is deducted from your treasury at the time of expansion. It is also worth noting that foreign expansion and expanding a Corporation to a city where one of its competitors' Corporate Offices is already present both increase the initial cost of expansion. ([BOLD]The Cost of Expansion[\BOLD]: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6106402#Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Free Market[COLOR_REVERT]. The Free Market Civic reduces Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Free Market is that its reduction is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this reduction comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Environmentalism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Environmentalism Civic increases Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Environmentalism is that its increase is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this increase comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Mercantilism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Mercantilism Civic negates the effects of all [BOLD]Foreign[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. Any Foreign Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Foreign Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the Mercantilism Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of Mercantilism:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Domestic Corporations cannot be founded (this is popularly viewed as a bug and is fixed in Bhruic's Unofficial BtS 3.13 patch: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6019403#post6019403).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]You do not have to buyout Foreign Corporate Offices when spreading Domestic Corporations. (thanks to jkp1187 for the reminder.)[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train a Corporate Executive for any Foreign Corporation.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporate Headquarters do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]State Property[COLOR_REVERT]. The State Property Civic negates the effects of [BOLD]all[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. All Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the State Property Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of State Property:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives. ([BOLD]This includes founding Domestic Corporations.[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train any Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporate Headquarters (both foreign and domestic) do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your Domestic Corporate Headquarters continue to gain +4 gold for every one of your Foreign Corporate Offices not under the Mercantilism or State Property Civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]City Improvements (Buildings)[COLOR_REVERT]. All Corporate Fees and benefits are raw yield values. This is important, because any buildings which reduce maintenance (i.e., Courthouse, Rathaus, etc.) or increase tile/specialist yields (i.e., Library, Forge, Wall Street, etc.) apply their appropriate affects to the Corporations' Fees or Benefits -- thus decreasing its impact and increasing its yield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Inflation[COLOR_REVERT]. Inflation is the last calculation applied to any Corporate Fees and is thus after all other factors are weighed. However, as of BtS patch 3.13, there is an additional factor applied during the calculation of the Corporate Fees which serves to reduce Corporate Fees and negate inflation. So, the most important thing to note is that [BOLD]inflation has no net effect on Corporate Maintenance in 3.13.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain.[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bear with me through this next section, because this one has all the math. A couple things to note first:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]a. Each city calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other cities in your empire.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]b. Each Corporate Office calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other Corporate Offices in the same city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]c. All Corporate Offices calculate their Corporate Fees identically (can be changed via the variable &lt;iMaintenance&gt; in CIV4CorporationInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are seven factors which determine a Corporate Office's Fees. These only take affect if a Corporation is consuming one or more resources in the city. (I.e, a Corporate Office denied access to the appropriate resources generates no fees but still provides +4 gold to its Corporate Headquarters):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Base Rate[COLOR_REVERT].

After reading this article, you should fully understand the different elements of Corporate Maintenance and how to fully calculate its impact on any of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So here we go ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Table of Contents (this article's pretty long)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Basics: Some Definitions[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]The Formula[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]An Example[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]A Comparison Using The Example[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Some Conclusions &amp; Thoughts On Corporate Management[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Other Articles[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]In Closing[NEWLINE]([ICON_BULLET]The Cost of Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Basics: Some Definitions (see the Civilopedia also)[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following definitions represent a brief introduction to some of the different relevant Corporate elements I may refer to during this post.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]To reduce the length of this post and get you to the part you probably came for quicker and more easily, I've hidden the definitions in spoiler tags. If you're already familiar with Corporations, you may wish to skip this section.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporations[COLOR_REVERT]. There are seven Corporations in BtS. Once you have both the "Corporation" technology (thanks to oedali for the reminder) and the technology enabling the particular Corporation's founding, you may found that Corporation by expending a Great Person to build its Corporate Headquarters building in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Corporations provide benefits to cities they are spread to in exchange for Corporate Fees, which manifest as City Maintenance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though I won't be going into detail about Resource Consumption and Corporate Competition, it is important to note that a Corporation cannot be founded in or spread to a city without access to any of its consumed resources and can never be founded in a city where a competitor's Corporate Headquarters is already present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Headquarters[COLOR_REVERT]. Every Corporation has only one Headquarters building -- present only in the city in which the Corporation was founded. Only a Great Person can build a Corporate Headquarters (and thus found the Corporation) and is consumed in doing so. The Corporate Headquarters also indicates the presence of the Corporation and thus provides the Corporation's benefits and incurs the appropriate Corporate Fees. The primary benefit of a Corporate Headquarters is that it generates +4 [ICON_GOLD] for every city with one of its Corporate Offices (i.e, that the Corporation has spread to).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It's worth noting a Corporate Headquarters building [BOLD]can only be built once[\BOLD]. If the Corporate Headquarters is destroyed, it is lost forever. To the best of my knowledge, the Corporate Headquarters can only be destroyed if the city it's in is conquered and razed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Office[COLOR_REVERT]. The presence of a Corporate Office in a city indicates the represented Corporation is present in the city. Thus, that city will incur the appropriate Corporate Fees in exchange for the Corporation's benefits. The Corporate Headquarters doubles as a Corporate Office.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporation[COLOR_REVERT]. A Foreign Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is not present in one of your cities (i.e., is not controlled by your civilization). A Domestic Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is present in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporate Office.[COLOR_REVERT] A Foreign Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in a foreign city -- regardless of whether it represents a Foreign or Domestic Corporation. Likewise, a Domestic Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in one of your cities -- even if the Corporate Headquarters is controlled by a foreign power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The distinction between "foreign" and "domestic" is especially important when discussing the effects of the Mercantilism and State Property Civics later on.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Executive[COLOR_REVERT]. Corporations are spread by Corporate Executives. These units can only be built in a city where the Corporation's Headquarters or Office is present. A Corporate Executive can only spread the Corporation he represents to one city and is consumed in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that expanding a Corporation (spreading it) requires an initial 'investment', which is deducted from your treasury at the time of expansion. It is also worth noting that foreign expansion and expanding a Corporation to a city where one of its competitors' Corporate Offices is already present both increase the initial cost of expansion. ([BOLD]The Cost of Expansion[\BOLD]: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6106402#Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Free Market[COLOR_REVERT]. The Free Market Civic reduces Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Free Market is that its reduction is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this reduction comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Environmentalism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Environmentalism Civic increases Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Environmentalism is that its increase is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this increase comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Mercantilism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Mercantilism Civic negates the effects of all [BOLD]Foreign[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. Any Foreign Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Foreign Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the Mercantilism Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of Mercantilism:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Domestic Corporations cannot be founded (this is popularly viewed as a bug and is fixed in Bhruic's Unofficial BtS 3.13 patch: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6019403#post6019403).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]You do not have to buyout Foreign Corporate Offices when spreading Domestic Corporations. (thanks to jkp1187 for the reminder.)[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train a Corporate Executive for any Foreign Corporation.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporate Headquarters do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]State Property[COLOR_REVERT]. The State Property Civic negates the effects of [BOLD]all[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. All Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the State Property Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of State Property:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives. ([BOLD]This includes founding Domestic Corporations.[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your cities cannot train any Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporate Headquarters (both foreign and domestic) do not gain +4 gold for their Corporate Offices in your cities.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Your Domestic Corporate Headquarters continue to gain +4 gold for every one of your Foreign Corporate Offices not under the Mercantilism or State Property Civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]City Improvements (Buildings)[COLOR_REVERT]. All Corporate Fees and benefits are raw yield values. This is important, because any buildings which reduce maintenance (i.e., Courthouse, Rathaus, etc.) or increase tile/specialist yields (i.e., Library, Forge, Wall Street, etc.) apply their appropriate affects to the Corporations' Fees or Benefits -- thus decreasing its impact and increasing its yield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Inflation[COLOR_REVERT]. Inflation is the last calculation applied to any Corporate Fees and is thus after all other factors are weighed. However, as of BtS patch 3.13, there is an additional factor applied during the calculation of the Corporate Fees which serves to reduce Corporate Fees and negate inflation. So, the most important thing to note is that [BOLD]inflation has no net effect on Corporate Maintenance in 3.13.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain.[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bear with me through this next section, because this one has all the math. A couple things to note first:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]a. Each city calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other cities in your empire.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]b. Each Corporate Office calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other Corporate Offices in the same city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]c. All Corporate Offices calculate their Corporate Fees identically (can be changed via the variable &lt;iMaintenance&gt; in CIV4CorporationInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are seven factors which determine a Corporate Office's Fees. These only take affect if a Corporation is consuming one or more resources in the city. (I.e, a Corporate Office denied access to the appropriate resources generates no fees but still provides +4 gold to its Corporate Headquarters):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Base Rate[COLOR_REVERT].

If you're already familiar with Corporations, you may wish to skip this section.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporations[COLOR_REVERT]. There are seven Corporations in BtS. Once you have both the "Corporation" technology (thanks to oedali for the reminder) and the technology enabling the particular Corporation's founding, you may found that Corporation by expending a Great Person to build its Corporate Headquarters building in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Corporations provide benefits to cities they are spread to in exchange for Corporate Fees, which manifest as City Maintenance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though I won't be going into detail about Resource Consumption and Corporate Competition, it is important to note that a Corporation cannot be founded in or spread to a city without access to any of its consumed resources and can never be founded in a city where a competitor's Corporate Headquarters is already present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Headquarters[COLOR_REVERT]. Every Corporation has only one Headquarters building -- present only in the city in which the Corporation was founded. Only a Great Person can build a Corporate Headquarters (and thus found the Corporation) and is consumed in doing so. The Corporate Headquarters also indicates the presence of the Corporation and thus provides the Corporation's benefits and incurs the appropriate Corporate Fees. The primary benefit of a Corporate Headquarters is that it generates +4 [ICON_GOLD] for every city with one of its Corporate Offices (i.e, that the Corporation has spread to).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It's worth noting a Corporate Headquarters building [BOLD]can only be built once[\BOLD]. If the Corporate Headquarters is destroyed, it is lost forever. To the best of my knowledge, the Corporate Headquarters can only be destroyed if the city it's in is conquered and razed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Office[COLOR_REVERT]. The presence of a Corporate Office in a city indicates the represented Corporation is present in the city. Thus, that city will incur the appropriate Corporate Fees in exchange for the Corporation's benefits. The Corporate Headquarters doubles as a Corporate Office.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporation[COLOR_REVERT]. A Foreign Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is not present in one of your cities (i.e., is not controlled by your civilization). A Domestic Corporation is any Corporation whose Corporate Headquarters is present in one of your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Foreign/Domestic Corporate Office.[COLOR_REVERT] A Foreign Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in a foreign city -- regardless of whether it represents a Foreign or Domestic Corporation. Likewise, a Domestic Corporate Office is any Corporate Office in one of your cities -- even if the Corporate Headquarters is controlled by a foreign power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The distinction between "foreign" and "domestic" is especially important when discussing the effects of the Mercantilism and State Property Civics later on.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Corporate Executive[COLOR_REVERT]. Corporations are spread by Corporate Executives. These units can only be built in a city where the Corporation's Headquarters or Office is present. A Corporate Executive can only spread the Corporation he represents to one city and is consumed in doing so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that expanding a Corporation (spreading it) requires an initial 'investment', which is deducted from your treasury at the time of expansion. It is also worth noting that foreign expansion and expanding a Corporation to a city where one of its competitors' Corporate Offices is already present both increase the initial cost of expansion. ([BOLD]The Cost of Expansion[\BOLD]: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6106402#Expansion)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Free Market[COLOR_REVERT]. The Free Market Civic reduces Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Free Market is that its reduction is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this reduction comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Environmentalism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Environmentalism Civic increases Maintenance Costs from Corporations by 25%. The important thing to know about Environmentalism is that its increase is at the very core of Corporate Fees and is not represented mathematically in any screen. Therefore, this increase comes [BOLD]before[\BOLD] Courthouses and Inflation![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Mercantilism[COLOR_REVERT]. The Mercantilism Civic negates the effects of all [BOLD]Foreign[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. Any Foreign Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Foreign Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the Mercantilism Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of Mercantilism:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Domestic Corporations cannot be founded (this is popularly viewed as a bug and is fixed in Bhruic's Unofficial BtS 3.13 patch: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=6019403#post6019403).[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Foreign Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives.[NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]You do not have to buyout Foreign Corporate Offices when spreading Domestic Corporations.

The State Property Civic negates the effects of [BOLD]all[\BOLD] Corporate Offices in your cities. All Corporate Offices already in your cities remain in your cities but yield no benefit to your cities or to their Corporate Headquarters. Likewise, if a foreign civilization is running the State Property Civic, your Corporate Offices will have no effect in their cities, and your Corporate Headquarters will not reap any benefits from those Foreign Corporate Offices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several noteworthy effects of State Property:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Corporations cannot be spread in your cities -- even by your own Corporate Executives.

All Corporate Fees and benefits are raw yield values. This is important, because any buildings which reduce maintenance (i.e., Courthouse, Rathaus, etc.) or increase tile/specialist yields (i.e., Library, Forge, Wall Street, etc.) apply their appropriate affects to the Corporations' Fees or Benefits -- thus decreasing its impact and increasing its yield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][COLOR_CYAN]Inflation[COLOR_REVERT]. Inflation is the last calculation applied to any Corporate Fees and is thus after all other factors are weighed. However, as of BtS patch 3.13, there is an additional factor applied during the calculation of the Corporate Fees which serves to reduce Corporate Fees and negate inflation. So, the most important thing to note is that [BOLD]inflation has no net effect on Corporate Maintenance in 3.13.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]The Not-So-Basics: The Man Behind The Curtain.[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bear with me through this next section, because this one has all the math. A couple things to note first:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]a. Each city calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other cities in your empire.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]b. Each Corporate Office calculates its own Corporate Fees independent of any other Corporate Offices in the same city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]c. All Corporate Offices calculate their Corporate Fees identically (can be changed via the variable &lt;iMaintenance&gt; in CIV4CorporationInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are seven factors which determine a Corporate Office's Fees. These only take affect if a Corporation is consuming one or more resources in the city.

		<English>[H1]Culture Mechanics Disassembled[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Deranged Duck[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE](Please note that all information given here is in regards to Vanilla Civ 1.61. It is probably unchanged in Warlords and the as yet unpublished Beyond the Sword expansion, but I have no way of being certain.)[NEWLINE](Also note that the following information will generally refer to normal speed games, unless otherwise noted. For games played on the Epic, Marathon, or Quick settings, some numbers listed below may be scaled somewhat.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several different values associated with culture in Civilization 4.[NEWLINE]First of all, there is the 'City Culture'. City culture actually affects only one thing: the city's cultural level and thus cultural radius. The city's cultural level and cultural radius start at '1'. When city culture reaches 10, the cultural level goes up to '2'. At 100, it goes up to '3', at 500 it reaches '4', at 5000, it reaches '5', and finally at 50,000 city culture it jumps up to '6', called "Legendary culture". Get 3 cities of level 6 and you win a cultural victory. Also note that a city actually has a cultural value and cultural radius for every player in the game. However, unless a player has actually owned a city at some point, their culture for that city is zero. If they are not the current owner of the city, their city culture will have zero impact on the game. City culture never goes away unless the city is destroyed, or the civilization to whom the culture belongs is destroyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course you were probably already familiar with 'City culture'. If not, you may need to actually go out and buy a copy of Civ 4 and play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is also a less accessible culture value, which I will call the 'plot culture'. Every square/tile/plot/whatever in the game also has a cultural value for every single player. You can't ever see the exact value, but it's not totally invisible. On the city screen, the relative values of 'plot culture' for various players are shown in the city screen if you point the mouse at the 'nationality' bar. If you point the mouse cursor at a square near a city, the %nationality of the plot owner(but nobody else) is shown.[NEWLINE]The main effect of plot culture is to determine whose civilization controls that particular plot of land. A civilization will own a plot, if at least one of its cities has that plot within its cultural radius, and if their plot culture is greater than any other civilization that has that plot within one of their cities' radii. Note that they have to actually own the city. If they built some culture in a city, but later lost control of that city, that city won't allow them to control any of the surrounding tiles. However, the culture that the city spilled onto the surrounding tiles might allow another of their cities to control those tiles. The exception to all this is plots containing cities. The city and the plot underneath will remain under the control of whoever founded or last conquered it, regardless of underlying culture. However, if the calculated cultural owner is different from the city owner (in other words, some other city, belonging to a different player has the plot within its cultural radius, and they have more culture on that plot), there is a chance of the city revolting and changing sides. We'll go into revolts in more detail later. Finally, note that plot culture can never ever be gotten rid of, except in a couple of circumstances. Firstly, if you give away a city, you lose all plot cultire in the city square and surrounding 8 squares. Secondly, if you completely obliterate a civilization, their plot culture goes away. Still, if a civilization owns no cities in an area, their culture won't have any effect except to alter the displayed nationality of squares in the region and to cause a small amount of unhappiness in cities who "long to join the motherland".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are probably wondering now where all these cultural values are coming from. The city culture is pretty easy, since the city screen clearly shows what all the sources of culture are. All the various temples, libraries, specialists, culture from the cultural slider, and culture from production are added up and then multiplied by the bonuses given by cathedrals, wonders, civics, and so on. This value, sometimes called CPT(Culture Per Turn), is added to the city's culture each and every turn. If this gives the city enough culture to increase it's cultural level and radius, these will also be increased.[NEWLINE]The city's CPT is also added to the plot culture of every plot within the city's cultural radius, regardless of ownership or presence or absence of other cities. However, there's an added factor based on the city's cultural radius. If the distance between the plot and the city is less than the cultural radius, then 20 times the difference is added to the plot culture as well. Note that the square that the city is on counts as being 1 space away and that this 20 value is not scaled with regards to game mode. It is always 20 per turn, period.[NEWLINE]To make sure that that's clear, let me describe it another way. Think of the city's potential cultural area as a series of rings. The first ring consists of the city and the 8 surrounding squares. The second ring contains the other 12 squares of the city's production area, and so on. When the city's cultural level is 1, only the first ring gets the points from the city's CPT. When the city's cultural level reaches 2, both first and second ring get the base CPT and the first ring also gets and additional 20 points a turn, even if the city isn't generating any culture at that time. When the city reaches it's third cultural expansion, The inner 9 squares get an extra 40 points, the next ring gets 20 points and so on. At the highest level of culture, the inner ring gets a whopping 100 extra points of plot culture per turn.[NEWLINE]When you found a city, you also get some plot culture to allow you to control the surrounding area, specifically 2 points on the city square and 1 point in the surrounding 8 squares. This is why newly founded cities are so easy to culturally overwhelm. All you need is a few turns of an obelisk and you've got a majority of culture in your neighbor's city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One last source of culture is the great artist. When added as an artist superspecialist, he merely contributes to the city's cultural (and science) production like any other specialist. However, when the artist is used to create a great work (often called a 'culture bomb'), it gets interesting. Of course, the 4000 culture points are instantly added to the city's culture. Guess how many of those 4000 points are added to the plot culture of the surrounding squares. The answer is zero. Of course, those familiar with culture bombing will be surprised by this, because they will remember using great works to take control of territory as well boost the city culture, so clearly something more complex is going on. Here's what actually happens:[NEWLINE]First, the city is brought out of revolt, if it is currently revolting. Then, the 4000 points (or whatever the value of the great artist happens to be) is broken up into 20 equal groups. The first group is added to the city's culture. The city's cultural level and radius are recalculated. Then, one turn worth of the city's current cultural output is added to the surrounding squares, including the 20 point bonus for each ring below the outermost ring. Repeat this process for the other 19 groups of great work culture.[NEWLINE]So, let's walk through what this does. Suppose a great artist creates a great work in a city that has no culture. The first of the 200 point groups of culture is added. This brings the city's culture level immediately up to 3. Now, although a turn worth of the city's culture is now delivered, the city has no culture and is producing no culture. So, the only plot culture gained is from those 20 point bonuses. The city plot and 8 surrounding squares thus get 40 points of plot culture. The next ring gets only 20 points in each square. Now, we repeat. The next 200 points is added. City's cultural level stays at 3. Same amount added to nearby squares. Third 200 points added. This brings the city's cultural level to 4, where it will stay for the remainder of the cultural delivery as we're only giving 4000 points and it needs 5000 for the next level. So, the innermost ring gets 60 culture each of 18 times, the next ring gets 40 culture 18 times, and the third ring gets 20 culture 18 times. Or, to sum it up, The first ring gets 1160 points of plot culture, the second ring gets 760, the third ring gets 360 and the fourth ring, although within the city's cultural radius gets nothing. This may seem like a lot, but consider if you sat on the city for a mere 20 turns, you'd double it. Of course, if the city also had any cultural production, that amount would be delivered 20 times to every square in the first 3 rings, and 18 times to the fourth ring.[NEWLINE]Note that when the city's culture is delivered, it is the amount that the city produces at that instant, not that turn. This should raise some mental red flags as possibly abusive, because yes, you can set your culture slider to 100, assign everyone to artist specialist, deliver your culture bomb, then set them back before ending your turn. Knowing this, you can get a great deal of benefit at no cost, if you know the trick. Well, actually, there is some cost, because to use this trick to say add another 1000 to all your squares' culture, you'd need first need to build the city up to where it can produce 50 CPT.[NEWLINE]I don't think that this would be a huge issue in most games. Normally a culture bomb would be used to gain minimal immediate control over a contested city. No time to build cultural buildings and not much cultural output anyway. However, if one's goal is to culturally overwhelm the opponents and force their cities to change sides, it becomes an issue, because one might actually want to culture bomb in a huge city with many cultural buildings in order to speed the revolt of a powerful neighboring city. In such games, it might be desireable to impose some sort of a rule, such as needing to leave the artists and culture slider there for 1 turn, or not being allowed to crank up culture at all, prior to bombing. Perhaps even being required to minimize rather than maximize cultural output prior to bomb. Of course, you could just add it to the list of strange things you might need to do to win a culture war game, along with clearing out large garrisons with helicopters and such. But, do whatever you find fun. It's not like I care how you play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, let's move on to the topic of revolts. A revolt in a city can occur if the owner of the city and the person who would own the underlying square if there were no city are different. In other words, a city might revolt if a neighboring city belonging to a different civilization has it within its cultural radius and that civilization's plot culture under the city is greater than the city's owner and that of all other civilizations with a city in range. You don't have to have a majority, you just have to have more of your nationality than the other guy. If a revolt can occur, there is a flat 10% chance each turn of making a revolt check.[NEWLINE]During a revolt check, a random number between 0 and the city's revolt power is compared with the garrison strength. If the number is greater than the garrison strength, the city revolts. Barbarian cities always fail this check, so will always revolt. If a city revolts there are several effects. All units in the city lose half their current hit points, the city's cultural radius becomes 0 and it produces nothing for a certain number of turns. Also, there is a possibility that the city may change sides (called a flip). A barbarian city will always flip, period. A non barbarian city won't flip if this is the first revolt (there is always one warning revolt). It also won't flip if the option "no city flipping" is on (this by default is off). It won't flip back to someone who has previously owned it, regardless of reason for ownership change, unless the game option "city flipping after conquest" is enabled (this is by default off). If a city flips, all units belonging to enemies of the new owner are destroyed. If the units aren't at war with the new owner, they simply get expelled unless the new owner has open borders with the units' owner.[NEWLINE]So, how is revolt power calculated? The base revolt power starts at 1 and then two factors are added. The first is 2x the city's highest ever population. The second is the number of directly adjacent squares that the revolting people's civilization controls times the current game era. Current game era is considered to be the average era of the remaining players, rounded down, with ancient being considered '1', medieval '2', and so on. So, in the final era (6), if the side the city wants to revolt for controls all 8 squares around the city, this could be as high as 48.[NEWLINE]The base revolt power is then multiplied by several factors. The first is the ratio of the two sides' plot culture for the city square. The formula for this multiplier is 1 + ((revoltCulture - cityOwnerCulture) / (revoltCulture)). This would be a number between 1 and 2, being near 2 if the revolt's plot culture is much higher than the owner, and being near 1 if the two are almost equal. If the revolt's plot culture is twice that of the city owner (i.e., 67% revolting nationality, 33% owner nationality), the value would be about 1.5. Sorry for the ugly math, but I can't find a way to explain it more simply at the moment.[NEWLINE]Fortunatly, the other multipliers are a bit simpler. If the revolting civilization's state religion is present, the value is doubled. If the city owner's state religion is present, the value is halved. If both are present, these two multipliers cancel each other out. If somebody doesn't have a state religion, they don't get a multiplier.[NEWLINE]The city's garrison strength is also simple. Start at 1 and add the cultural garrison strength of all units in the city, regardless of ownership. Double this if the owner and revolting civilization are at war. The only catch is that cultural garrison strength can't be found in game, so here is a list of unit values:[NEWLINE]warrior, quecha: 3[NEWLINE]archer, skirmisher, axe, spear, phalanx, chariot, immortal, catapult: 4[NEWLINE]swordsman, jaguar, praetorian, horsearcher, keshik, war elephant: 5[NEWLINE]mace, samurai, pike, longbow, crossbow, chokonu, knight, camelarcher, conquistador: 6[NEWLINE]musketman, musketeer, grenadier, cannon: 7[NEWLINE]rifle, redcoat, calvalry, cossack: 8[NEWLINE]machine gun: 9[NEWLINE]infantry, SAM infantry, gunship, artillery: 10[NEWLINE]marine, SEAL, tank, panzer: 12[NEWLINE]mech infantry, modern armor: 16[NEWLINE]Note that ships, planes, workers, great people, and other non-military or non-land units don't help keep a city under control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, now that all that stuff above has been covered, let's give some actual examples, so you can see what it means:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 1: Low culture capital[NEWLINE]Consider a capital city with just a palace and no other cultural buildings. Suppose that the owner just sits there and builds no cultural buildings for 200 turns. How would this work out? Well, the palace produces 2 culture per turn, so at the start, the 9 initial city squares are going to get that amount for 5 turns (total 10), when the cultural radius expands. For the next 45 turns, the first two rings would be getting that 2 CPT and the inner ring would get an extra 20 per turn. Then the Radius expands and for the next 150 turns, the 3 city rings all get 2 culture, with the outer getting 20 extra and the inner getting 40 extra. So, let's add this up. The city of course would end up at radius 3 with a flat 400 culture. The third ring would get a modest 300 points of plot culture, not too hard to invade. The second ring would get 3390. The inner ring, including the city square would get a whopping 7300. For another civ to get a majority in the area, they would need to beat that. If they took the city and just started culture bombing, they'd need around 6 great artists to gain that majority, unless of course they put some more culture in the city. The lesson? Sitting on a spot for a long time counts a lot with regards to cultural control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 2: Cultural Nuke[NEWLINE]Okay, suppose you've got a city that you've got a city that you've built up culturally, in order to flip an enemy capital, say, the city in the previous example, which is 3 squares away, the minimum distance between 2 cities on the same landmass (cities on different landmasses can be 2 squares away, oddly enough). You've decided that you're okay with maximizing cultural output to increase culture bomb yield, so you crank the up the culture slider to 100%. You've really built the city up and it already has 900 culture. It also has 14 towns within it's production radius. With 4 base commerce, +2 for free speech, +1 for printing press and +1 for financial, this is 8 culture per square, more than the 6 that an artist specialist gives you with sistine chapel, so you leave 14 people on towns for 113 CPT. One of your people is already an artist, and you have the other 7 join him, with sistine, that's another 48 CPT. You've also got assorted buildings: 5 temples (+5), a Library (+2), a Theatre (+3), and 2 monastaries (+4). Add all the numbers up for 175 CPT Of course, you didn't forget the cultural multipliers either: 4 cathedrals and the hermitage, not to mention Free speech, for a 400% bonus. 5 X 175 is 825 CPT. Yowza! Okay, so you send in your Great Artist and erm, detonate him. Every single square in the city radius istantly gets the equivalent of 20 turns of that 825 CPT, including the enemy capital that you are trying to flip. That's 16500. Oh, and since the enemy capital is in the second to outermost ring of your cultural influence, it gets an additional 400 points from that 20 point per turn bonus.[NEWLINE]Now, if you hadn't assigned those artists and cranked you'd only have a base of 20, which, with multipliers, would become a mere 100 CPT. The total sum of 20 turns (with the same 400 bonus points) would be 2400. So, you got 7 times the effect for making a temporary adjustment to your production, which you will now switch back. Basically, you got 7 Great Artists for the price of one by exploiting a hole in the game mechanics. Now, if this doesn't bother your conscience just a wee bit, remind me not to allow you in my house unsupervised.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 3: The English are Revolting[NEWLINE]This following example actually happened in a recent game of mine. In this particular game, the English happened to be one of my neighbors and, as neighbors are wont to do, Viki decided to stick a knife in my back while I was off invading Mali. The main effect of this little skirmish was that I ended up owning one of Viki's cities (Oh, and I called off my invasion of Mali and a few million people died and one of my cities got trashed from pillaging and repeatedly changing hands, but that's not important). Deciding that it wouldn't be worth the trouble to keep up the fight, I negotiated a peace treaty and resumed plotting to crush Mali at my earliest convenience.[NEWLINE]This English city that I had captured was culturally very advanced and was something like 4 or 5 squares from their capital. Looking at the city, I noticed a high probability of revolt, somewhere around 9%. Now, if I had remembered the default 'no city flipping after conquest' setting, I might not have been so concerned, but I was thinking civ3 and I was afraid it was going to revolt back, so I started building culture and sending in more troops. With a garrison of 20 troops, a culture bomb, many buildings, and 29% of the population switched to my nationality, the !@#$% city was still trying to revolt. Several revolts later, I added a bunch of mech infantry and finally got the unrest under control, at which point my next invasion of Mali triggered an unnoticed defensive pact, forcing me to destroy the English as well and gain a domination victory, meaning no more chance of revolt, so all my anti-unrest measures were a waste of time anyway.[NEWLINE]Anyway, let's see what was going on. Sometime in the renaissance era (Most players were Industrial, but remember, the era is the players' average era, rounded down) the city had a population of 14 and 4 of the 8 surrounding squares were still under english cultural control. So, multiply the population by 2 and the squares by 4 (renaissance being the 4th era) and we get a base revolt power of 44. Given that 29% of the city was my nationality, we multiply this by 1.59 (this is the approximate result of the nationality ratio equation given above), giving 69. In the interests of diplomacy, I had no state religion, while the city contained Elizabeth's state religion, Confusianism. In fact, it was the Confusian holy city, but this doesn't give any bonuses. Still, her state religion doubles her revolt power. Anyway, we get a revolt power of 138. Okay, the garrison at this point consists of 4 archers, 9 longbows, 1 horse archer, 2 grenadiers and 4 infantry. Add up the numbers and add 1 and we get 130. Hmm. All those troops aren't quite enough. Now maybe if I had a state religion or could've gotten Elizabeth to drop hers, I'd have had an easier time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 4: Modding Fun[NEWLINE]The Mod "FallFromHeaven100" (not to be confused with "FallFromHeaven200", which is too big for my modem, so I've never tried it) contains an interesting take on the missionary unit. Not only is it a medic I combat unit, at least some of the missionary units have the ability to create a tiny great work of art. 20 points of culture, to be exact. Now the intention of this unit was probably to allow a player to throw some quick culture in and get at least 1 culture level and stop any revolt in progress. However, due to the underlying cultural formula, this still gives 20 turns of culture to every square in the city's cultural radius. Not only that, unlike the rare and hard to acquire Great Artist, you can build these guys cheaply in whatever numbers your cities can produce. Of course, while you're busy dropping a mini culture bomb every turn or two, your enemies will be busy outteching your economic mess of a civilization. It can be a bit uncool when the enemy walks over your borders with heavy crossbowmen (power 13) while you're still using archers (power 3, just like standard civ).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of information:[NEWLINE]Most information given here was acquired by reading the source code in the civ4 SDK, available from Firaxis.

		<French>[H1]Culture Mechanics Disassembled[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Deranged Duck[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE](Please note that all information given here is in regards to Vanilla Civ 1.61. It is probably unchanged in Warlords and the as yet unpublished Beyond the Sword expansion, but I have no way of being certain.)[NEWLINE](Also note that the following information will generally refer to normal speed games, unless otherwise noted. For games played on the Epic, Marathon, or Quick settings, some numbers listed below may be scaled somewhat.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several different values associated with culture in Civilization 4.[NEWLINE]First of all, there is the 'City Culture'. City culture actually affects only one thing: the city's cultural level and thus cultural radius. The city's cultural level and cultural radius start at '1'. When city culture reaches 10, the cultural level goes up to '2'. At 100, it goes up to '3', at 500 it reaches '4', at 5000, it reaches '5', and finally at 50,000 city culture it jumps up to '6', called "Legendary culture". Get 3 cities of level 6 and you win a cultural victory. Also note that a city actually has a cultural value and cultural radius for every player in the game. However, unless a player has actually owned a city at some point, their culture for that city is zero. If they are not the current owner of the city, their city culture will have zero impact on the game. City culture never goes away unless the city is destroyed, or the civilization to whom the culture belongs is destroyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course you were probably already familiar with 'City culture'. If not, you may need to actually go out and buy a copy of Civ 4 and play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is also a less accessible culture value, which I will call the 'plot culture'. Every square/tile/plot/whatever in the game also has a cultural value for every single player. You can't ever see the exact value, but it's not totally invisible. On the city screen, the relative values of 'plot culture' for various players are shown in the city screen if you point the mouse at the 'nationality' bar. If you point the mouse cursor at a square near a city, the %nationality of the plot owner(but nobody else) is shown.[NEWLINE]The main effect of plot culture is to determine whose civilization controls that particular plot of land. A civilization will own a plot, if at least one of its cities has that plot within its cultural radius, and if their plot culture is greater than any other civilization that has that plot within one of their cities' radii. Note that they have to actually own the city. If they built some culture in a city, but later lost control of that city, that city won't allow them to control any of the surrounding tiles. However, the culture that the city spilled onto the surrounding tiles might allow another of their cities to control those tiles. The exception to all this is plots containing cities. The city and the plot underneath will remain under the control of whoever founded or last conquered it, regardless of underlying culture. However, if the calculated cultural owner is different from the city owner (in other words, some other city, belonging to a different player has the plot within its cultural radius, and they have more culture on that plot), there is a chance of the city revolting and changing sides. We'll go into revolts in more detail later. Finally, note that plot culture can never ever be gotten rid of, except in a couple of circumstances. Firstly, if you give away a city, you lose all plot cultire in the city square and surrounding 8 squares. Secondly, if you completely obliterate a civilization, their plot culture goes away. Still, if a civilization owns no cities in an area, their culture won't have any effect except to alter the displayed nationality of squares in the region and to cause a small amount of unhappiness in cities who "long to join the motherland".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are probably wondering now where all these cultural values are coming from. The city culture is pretty easy, since the city screen clearly shows what all the sources of culture are. All the various temples, libraries, specialists, culture from the cultural slider, and culture from production are added up and then multiplied by the bonuses given by cathedrals, wonders, civics, and so on. This value, sometimes called CPT(Culture Per Turn), is added to the city's culture each and every turn. If this gives the city enough culture to increase it's cultural level and radius, these will also be increased.[NEWLINE]The city's CPT is also added to the plot culture of every plot within the city's cultural radius, regardless of ownership or presence or absence of other cities. However, there's an added factor based on the city's cultural radius. If the distance between the plot and the city is less than the cultural radius, then 20 times the difference is added to the plot culture as well. Note that the square that the city is on counts as being 1 space away and that this 20 value is not scaled with regards to game mode. It is always 20 per turn, period.[NEWLINE]To make sure that that's clear, let me describe it another way. Think of the city's potential cultural area as a series of rings. The first ring consists of the city and the 8 surrounding squares. The second ring contains the other 12 squares of the city's production area, and so on. When the city's cultural level is 1, only the first ring gets the points from the city's CPT. When the city's cultural level reaches 2, both first and second ring get the base CPT and the first ring also gets and additional 20 points a turn, even if the city isn't generating any culture at that time. When the city reaches it's third cultural expansion, The inner 9 squares get an extra 40 points, the next ring gets 20 points and so on. At the highest level of culture, the inner ring gets a whopping 100 extra points of plot culture per turn.[NEWLINE]When you found a city, you also get some plot culture to allow you to control the surrounding area, specifically 2 points on the city square and 1 point in the surrounding 8 squares. This is why newly founded cities are so easy to culturally overwhelm. All you need is a few turns of an obelisk and you've got a majority of culture in your neighbor's city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One last source of culture is the great artist. When added as an artist superspecialist, he merely contributes to the city's cultural (and science) production like any other specialist. However, when the artist is used to create a great work (often called a 'culture bomb'), it gets interesting. Of course, the 4000 culture points are instantly added to the city's culture. Guess how many of those 4000 points are added to the plot culture of the surrounding squares. The answer is zero. Of course, those familiar with culture bombing will be surprised by this, because they will remember using great works to take control of territory as well boost the city culture, so clearly something more complex is going on. Here's what actually happens:[NEWLINE]First, the city is brought out of revolt, if it is currently revolting. Then, the 4000 points (or whatever the value of the great artist happens to be) is broken up into 20 equal groups. The first group is added to the city's culture. The city's cultural level and radius are recalculated. Then, one turn worth of the city's current cultural output is added to the surrounding squares, including the 20 point bonus for each ring below the outermost ring. Repeat this process for the other 19 groups of great work culture.[NEWLINE]So, let's walk through what this does. Suppose a great artist creates a great work in a city that has no culture. The first of the 200 point groups of culture is added. This brings the city's culture level immediately up to 3. Now, although a turn worth of the city's culture is now delivered, the city has no culture and is producing no culture. So, the only plot culture gained is from those 20 point bonuses. The city plot and 8 surrounding squares thus get 40 points of plot culture. The next ring gets only 20 points in each square. Now, we repeat. The next 200 points is added. City's cultural level stays at 3. Same amount added to nearby squares. Third 200 points added. This brings the city's cultural level to 4, where it will stay for the remainder of the cultural delivery as we're only giving 4000 points and it needs 5000 for the next level. So, the innermost ring gets 60 culture each of 18 times, the next ring gets 40 culture 18 times, and the third ring gets 20 culture 18 times. Or, to sum it up, The first ring gets 1160 points of plot culture, the second ring gets 760, the third ring gets 360 and the fourth ring, although within the city's cultural radius gets nothing. This may seem like a lot, but consider if you sat on the city for a mere 20 turns, you'd double it. Of course, if the city also had any cultural production, that amount would be delivered 20 times to every square in the first 3 rings, and 18 times to the fourth ring.[NEWLINE]Note that when the city's culture is delivered, it is the amount that the city produces at that instant, not that turn. This should raise some mental red flags as possibly abusive, because yes, you can set your culture slider to 100, assign everyone to artist specialist, deliver your culture bomb, then set them back before ending your turn. Knowing this, you can get a great deal of benefit at no cost, if you know the trick. Well, actually, there is some cost, because to use this trick to say add another 1000 to all your squares' culture, you'd need first need to build the city up to where it can produce 50 CPT.[NEWLINE]I don't think that this would be a huge issue in most games. Normally a culture bomb would be used to gain minimal immediate control over a contested city. No time to build cultural buildings and not much cultural output anyway. However, if one's goal is to culturally overwhelm the opponents and force their cities to change sides, it becomes an issue, because one might actually want to culture bomb in a huge city with many cultural buildings in order to speed the revolt of a powerful neighboring city. In such games, it might be desireable to impose some sort of a rule, such as needing to leave the artists and culture slider there for 1 turn, or not being allowed to crank up culture at all, prior to bombing. Perhaps even being required to minimize rather than maximize cultural output prior to bomb. Of course, you could just add it to the list of strange things you might need to do to win a culture war game, along with clearing out large garrisons with helicopters and such. But, do whatever you find fun. It's not like I care how you play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, let's move on to the topic of revolts. A revolt in a city can occur if the owner of the city and the person who would own the underlying square if there were no city are different. In other words, a city might revolt if a neighboring city belonging to a different civilization has it within its cultural radius and that civilization's plot culture under the city is greater than the city's owner and that of all other civilizations with a city in range. You don't have to have a majority, you just have to have more of your nationality than the other guy. If a revolt can occur, there is a flat 10% chance each turn of making a revolt check.[NEWLINE]During a revolt check, a random number between 0 and the city's revolt power is compared with the garrison strength. If the number is greater than the garrison strength, the city revolts. Barbarian cities always fail this check, so will always revolt. If a city revolts there are several effects. All units in the city lose half their current hit points, the city's cultural radius becomes 0 and it produces nothing for a certain number of turns. Also, there is a possibility that the city may change sides (called a flip). A barbarian city will always flip, period. A non barbarian city won't flip if this is the first revolt (there is always one warning revolt). It also won't flip if the option "no city flipping" is on (this by default is off). It won't flip back to someone who has previously owned it, regardless of reason for ownership change, unless the game option "city flipping after conquest" is enabled (this is by default off). If a city flips, all units belonging to enemies of the new owner are destroyed. If the units aren't at war with the new owner, they simply get expelled unless the new owner has open borders with the units' owner.[NEWLINE]So, how is revolt power calculated? The base revolt power starts at 1 and then two factors are added. The first is 2x the city's highest ever population. The second is the number of directly adjacent squares that the revolting people's civilization controls times the current game era. Current game era is considered to be the average era of the remaining players, rounded down, with ancient being considered '1', medieval '2', and so on. So, in the final era (6), if the side the city wants to revolt for controls all 8 squares around the city, this could be as high as 48.[NEWLINE]The base revolt power is then multiplied by several factors. The first is the ratio of the two sides' plot culture for the city square. The formula for this multiplier is 1 + ((revoltCulture - cityOwnerCulture) / (revoltCulture)). This would be a number between 1 and 2, being near 2 if the revolt's plot culture is much higher than the owner, and being near 1 if the two are almost equal. If the revolt's plot culture is twice that of the city owner (i.e., 67% revolting nationality, 33% owner nationality), the value would be about 1.5. Sorry for the ugly math, but I can't find a way to explain it more simply at the moment.[NEWLINE]Fortunatly, the other multipliers are a bit simpler. If the revolting civilization's state religion is present, the value is doubled. If the city owner's state religion is present, the value is halved. If both are present, these two multipliers cancel each other out. If somebody doesn't have a state religion, they don't get a multiplier.[NEWLINE]The city's garrison strength is also simple. Start at 1 and add the cultural garrison strength of all units in the city, regardless of ownership. Double this if the owner and revolting civilization are at war. The only catch is that cultural garrison strength can't be found in game, so here is a list of unit values:[NEWLINE]warrior, quecha: 3[NEWLINE]archer, skirmisher, axe, spear, phalanx, chariot, immortal, catapult: 4[NEWLINE]swordsman, jaguar, praetorian, horsearcher, keshik, war elephant: 5[NEWLINE]mace, samurai, pike, longbow, crossbow, chokonu, knight, camelarcher, conquistador: 6[NEWLINE]musketman, musketeer, grenadier, cannon: 7[NEWLINE]rifle, redcoat, calvalry, cossack: 8[NEWLINE]machine gun: 9[NEWLINE]infantry, SAM infantry, gunship, artillery: 10[NEWLINE]marine, SEAL, tank, panzer: 12[NEWLINE]mech infantry, modern armor: 16[NEWLINE]Note that ships, planes, workers, great people, and other non-military or non-land units don't help keep a city under control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, now that all that stuff above has been covered, let's give some actual examples, so you can see what it means:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 1: Low culture capital[NEWLINE]Consider a capital city with just a palace and no other cultural buildings. Suppose that the owner just sits there and builds no cultural buildings for 200 turns. How would this work out? Well, the palace produces 2 culture per turn, so at the start, the 9 initial city squares are going to get that amount for 5 turns (total 10), when the cultural radius expands. For the next 45 turns, the first two rings would be getting that 2 CPT and the inner ring would get an extra 20 per turn. Then the Radius expands and for the next 150 turns, the 3 city rings all get 2 culture, with the outer getting 20 extra and the inner getting 40 extra. So, let's add this up. The city of course would end up at radius 3 with a flat 400 culture. The third ring would get a modest 300 points of plot culture, not too hard to invade. The second ring would get 3390. The inner ring, including the city square would get a whopping 7300. For another civ to get a majority in the area, they would need to beat that. If they took the city and just started culture bombing, they'd need around 6 great artists to gain that majority, unless of course they put some more culture in the city. The lesson? Sitting on a spot for a long time counts a lot with regards to cultural control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 2: Cultural Nuke[NEWLINE]Okay, suppose you've got a city that you've got a city that you've built up culturally, in order to flip an enemy capital, say, the city in the previous example, which is 3 squares away, the minimum distance between 2 cities on the same landmass (cities on different landmasses can be 2 squares away, oddly enough). You've decided that you're okay with maximizing cultural output to increase culture bomb yield, so you crank the up the culture slider to 100%. You've really built the city up and it already has 900 culture. It also has 14 towns within it's production radius. With 4 base commerce, +2 for free speech, +1 for printing press and +1 for financial, this is 8 culture per square, more than the 6 that an artist specialist gives you with sistine chapel, so you leave 14 people on towns for 113 CPT. One of your people is already an artist, and you have the other 7 join him, with sistine, that's another 48 CPT. You've also got assorted buildings: 5 temples (+5), a Library (+2), a Theatre (+3), and 2 monastaries (+4). Add all the numbers up for 175 CPT Of course, you didn't forget the cultural multipliers either: 4 cathedrals and the hermitage, not to mention Free speech, for a 400% bonus. 5 X 175 is 825 CPT. Yowza! Okay, so you send in your Great Artist and erm, detonate him. Every single square in the city radius istantly gets the equivalent of 20 turns of that 825 CPT, including the enemy capital that you are trying to flip. That's 16500. Oh, and since the enemy capital is in the second to outermost ring of your cultural influence, it gets an additional 400 points from that 20 point per turn bonus.[NEWLINE]Now, if you hadn't assigned those artists and cranked you'd only have a base of 20, which, with multipliers, would become a mere 100 CPT. The total sum of 20 turns (with the same 400 bonus points) would be 2400. So, you got 7 times the effect for making a temporary adjustment to your production, which you will now switch back. Basically, you got 7 Great Artists for the price of one by exploiting a hole in the game mechanics. Now, if this doesn't bother your conscience just a wee bit, remind me not to allow you in my house unsupervised.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 3: The English are Revolting[NEWLINE]This following example actually happened in a recent game of mine. In this particular game, the English happened to be one of my neighbors and, as neighbors are wont to do, Viki decided to stick a knife in my back while I was off invading Mali. The main effect of this little skirmish was that I ended up owning one of Viki's cities (Oh, and I called off my invasion of Mali and a few million people died and one of my cities got trashed from pillaging and repeatedly changing hands, but that's not important). Deciding that it wouldn't be worth the trouble to keep up the fight, I negotiated a peace treaty and resumed plotting to crush Mali at my earliest convenience.[NEWLINE]This English city that I had captured was culturally very advanced and was something like 4 or 5 squares from their capital. Looking at the city, I noticed a high probability of revolt, somewhere around 9%. Now, if I had remembered the default 'no city flipping after conquest' setting, I might not have been so concerned, but I was thinking civ3 and I was afraid it was going to revolt back, so I started building culture and sending in more troops. With a garrison of 20 troops, a culture bomb, many buildings, and 29% of the population switched to my nationality, the !@#$% city was still trying to revolt. Several revolts later, I added a bunch of mech infantry and finally got the unrest under control, at which point my next invasion of Mali triggered an unnoticed defensive pact, forcing me to destroy the English as well and gain a domination victory, meaning no more chance of revolt, so all my anti-unrest measures were a waste of time anyway.[NEWLINE]Anyway, let's see what was going on. Sometime in the renaissance era (Most players were Industrial, but remember, the era is the players' average era, rounded down) the city had a population of 14 and 4 of the 8 surrounding squares were still under english cultural control. So, multiply the population by 2 and the squares by 4 (renaissance being the 4th era) and we get a base revolt power of 44. Given that 29% of the city was my nationality, we multiply this by 1.59 (this is the approximate result of the nationality ratio equation given above), giving 69. In the interests of diplomacy, I had no state religion, while the city contained Elizabeth's state religion, Confusianism. In fact, it was the Confusian holy city, but this doesn't give any bonuses. Still, her state religion doubles her revolt power. Anyway, we get a revolt power of 138. Okay, the garrison at this point consists of 4 archers, 9 longbows, 1 horse archer, 2 grenadiers and 4 infantry. Add up the numbers and add 1 and we get 130. Hmm. All those troops aren't quite enough. Now maybe if I had a state religion or could've gotten Elizabeth to drop hers, I'd have had an easier time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 4: Modding Fun[NEWLINE]The Mod "FallFromHeaven100" (not to be confused with "FallFromHeaven200", which is too big for my modem, so I've never tried it) contains an interesting take on the missionary unit.

Now the intention of this unit was probably to allow a player to throw some quick culture in and get at least 1 culture level and stop any revolt in progress. However, due to the underlying cultural formula, this still gives 20 turns of culture to every square in the city's cultural radius. Not only that, unlike the rare and hard to acquire Great Artist, you can build these guys cheaply in whatever numbers your cities can produce.

When the city's cultural level reaches 2, both first and second ring get the base CPT and the first ring also gets and additional 20 points a turn, even if the city isn't generating any culture at that time. When the city reaches it's third cultural expansion, The inner 9 squares get an extra 40 points, the next ring gets 20 points and so on. At the highest level of culture, the inner ring gets a whopping 100 extra points of plot culture per turn.[NEWLINE]When you found a city, you also get some plot culture to allow you to control the surrounding area, specifically 2 points on the city square and 1 point in the surrounding 8 squares. This is why newly founded cities are so easy to culturally overwhelm. All you need is a few turns of an obelisk and you've got a majority of culture in your neighbor's city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One last source of culture is the great artist. When added as an artist superspecialist, he merely contributes to the city's cultural (and science) production like any other specialist. However, when the artist is used to create a great work (often called a 'culture bomb'), it gets interesting. Of course, the 4000 culture points are instantly added to the city's culture. Guess how many of those 4000 points are added to the plot culture of the surrounding squares. The answer is zero. Of course, those familiar with culture bombing will be surprised by this, because they will remember using great works to take control of territory as well boost the city culture, so clearly something more complex is going on. Here's what actually happens:[NEWLINE]First, the city is brought out of revolt, if it is currently revolting. Then, the 4000 points (or whatever the value of the great artist happens to be) is broken up into 20 equal groups. The first group is added to the city's culture. The city's cultural level and radius are recalculated. Then, one turn worth of the city's current cultural output is added to the surrounding squares, including the 20 point bonus for each ring below the outermost ring. Repeat this process for the other 19 groups of great work culture.[NEWLINE]So, let's walk through what this does. Suppose a great artist creates a great work in a city that has no culture. The first of the 200 point groups of culture is added. This brings the city's culture level immediately up to 3. Now, although a turn worth of the city's culture is now delivered, the city has no culture and is producing no culture. So, the only plot culture gained is from those 20 point bonuses. The city plot and 8 surrounding squares thus get 40 points of plot culture. The next ring gets only 20 points in each square. Now, we repeat. The next 200 points is added. City's cultural level stays at 3. Same amount added to nearby squares. Third 200 points added. This brings the city's cultural level to 4, where it will stay for the remainder of the cultural delivery as we're only giving 4000 points and it needs 5000 for the next level. So, the innermost ring gets 60 culture each of 18 times, the next ring gets 40 culture 18 times, and the third ring gets 20 culture 18 times. Or, to sum it up, The first ring gets 1160 points of plot culture, the second ring gets 760, the third ring gets 360 and the fourth ring, although within the city's cultural radius gets nothing. This may seem like a lot, but consider if you sat on the city for a mere 20 turns, you'd double it. Of course, if the city also had any cultural production, that amount would be delivered 20 times to every square in the first 3 rings, and 18 times to the fourth ring.[NEWLINE]Note that when the city's culture is delivered, it is the amount that the city produces at that instant, not that turn. This should raise some mental red flags as possibly abusive, because yes, you can set your culture slider to 100, assign everyone to artist specialist, deliver your culture bomb, then set them back before ending your turn. Knowing this, you can get a great deal of benefit at no cost, if you know the trick. Well, actually, there is some cost, because to use this trick to say add another 1000 to all your squares' culture, you'd need first need to build the city up to where it can produce 50 CPT.[NEWLINE]I don't think that this would be a huge issue in most games. Normally a culture bomb would be used to gain minimal immediate control over a contested city. No time to build cultural buildings and not much cultural output anyway. However, if one's goal is to culturally overwhelm the opponents and force their cities to change sides, it becomes an issue, because one might actually want to culture bomb in a huge city with many cultural buildings in order to speed the revolt of a powerful neighboring city. In such games, it might be desireable to impose some sort of a rule, such as needing to leave the artists and culture slider there for 1 turn, or not being allowed to crank up culture at all, prior to bombing. Perhaps even being required to minimize rather than maximize cultural output prior to bomb. Of course, you could just add it to the list of strange things you might need to do to win a culture war game, along with clearing out large garrisons with helicopters and such. But, do whatever you find fun. It's not like I care how you play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, let's move on to the topic of revolts. A revolt in a city can occur if the owner of the city and the person who would own the underlying square if there were no city are different. In other words, a city might revolt if a neighboring city belonging to a different civilization has it within its cultural radius and that civilization's plot culture under the city is greater than the city's owner and that of all other civilizations with a city in range. You don't have to have a majority, you just have to have more of your nationality than the other guy. If a revolt can occur, there is a flat 10% chance each turn of making a revolt check.[NEWLINE]During a revolt check, a random number between 0 and the city's revolt power is compared with the garrison strength. If the number is greater than the garrison strength, the city revolts. Barbarian cities always fail this check, so will always revolt. If a city revolts there are several effects. All units in the city lose half their current hit points, the city's cultural radius becomes 0 and it produces nothing for a certain number of turns. Also, there is a possibility that the city may change sides (called a flip). A barbarian city will always flip, period. A non barbarian city won't flip if this is the first revolt (there is always one warning revolt). It also won't flip if the option "no city flipping" is on (this by default is off). It won't flip back to someone who has previously owned it, regardless of reason for ownership change, unless the game option "city flipping after conquest" is enabled (this is by default off). If a city flips, all units belonging to enemies of the new owner are destroyed. If the units aren't at war with the new owner, they simply get expelled unless the new owner has open borders with the units' owner.[NEWLINE]So, how is revolt power calculated? The base revolt power starts at 1 and then two factors are added. The first is 2x the city's highest ever population. The second is the number of directly adjacent squares that the revolting people's civilization controls times the current game era. Current game era is considered to be the average era of the remaining players, rounded down, with ancient being considered '1', medieval '2', and so on. So, in the final era (6), if the side the city wants to revolt for controls all 8 squares around the city, this could be as high as 48.[NEWLINE]The base revolt power is then multiplied by several factors. The first is the ratio of the two sides' plot culture for the city square. The formula for this multiplier is 1 + ((revoltCulture - cityOwnerCulture) / (revoltCulture)). This would be a number between 1 and 2, being near 2 if the revolt's plot culture is much higher than the owner, and being near 1 if the two are almost equal. If the revolt's plot culture is twice that of the city owner (i.e., 67% revolting nationality, 33% owner nationality), the value would be about 1.5. Sorry for the ugly math, but I can't find a way to explain it more simply at the moment.[NEWLINE]Fortunatly, the other multipliers are a bit simpler. If the revolting civilization's state religion is present, the value is doubled. If the city owner's state religion is present, the value is halved. If both are present, these two multipliers cancel each other out. If somebody doesn't have a state religion, they don't get a multiplier.[NEWLINE]The city's garrison strength is also simple. Start at 1 and add the cultural garrison strength of all units in the city, regardless of ownership. Double this if the owner and revolting civilization are at war. The only catch is that cultural garrison strength can't be found in game, so here is a list of unit values:[NEWLINE]warrior, quecha: 3[NEWLINE]archer, skirmisher, axe, spear, phalanx, chariot, immortal, catapult: 4[NEWLINE]swordsman, jaguar, praetorian, horsearcher, keshik, war elephant: 5[NEWLINE]mace, samurai, pike, longbow, crossbow, chokonu, knight, camelarcher, conquistador: 6[NEWLINE]musketman, musketeer, grenadier, cannon: 7[NEWLINE]rifle, redcoat, calvalry, cossack: 8[NEWLINE]machine gun: 9[NEWLINE]infantry, SAM infantry, gunship, artillery: 10[NEWLINE]marine, SEAL, tank, panzer: 12[NEWLINE]mech infantry, modern armor: 16[NEWLINE]Note that ships, planes, workers, great people, and other non-military or non-land units don't help keep a city under control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, now that all that stuff above has been covered, let's give some actual examples, so you can see what it means:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 1: Low culture capital[NEWLINE]Consider a capital city with just a palace and no other cultural buildings. Suppose that the owner just sits there and builds no cultural buildings for 200 turns. How would this work out? Well, the palace produces 2 culture per turn, so at the start, the 9 initial city squares are going to get that amount for 5 turns (total 10), when the cultural radius expands. For the next 45 turns, the first two rings would be getting that 2 CPT and the inner ring would get an extra 20 per turn. Then the Radius expands and for the next 150 turns, the 3 city rings all get 2 culture, with the outer getting 20 extra and the inner getting 40 extra. So, let's add this up. The city of course would end up at radius 3 with a flat 400 culture. The third ring would get a modest 300 points of plot culture, not too hard to invade. The second ring would get 3390. The inner ring, including the city square would get a whopping 7300. For another civ to get a majority in the area, they would need to beat that. If they took the city and just started culture bombing, they'd need around 6 great artists to gain that majority, unless of course they put some more culture in the city. The lesson? Sitting on a spot for a long time counts a lot with regards to cultural control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 2: Cultural Nuke[NEWLINE]Okay, suppose you've got a city that you've got a city that you've built up culturally, in order to flip an enemy capital, say, the city in the previous example, which is 3 squares away, the minimum distance between 2 cities on the same landmass (cities on different landmasses can be 2 squares away, oddly enough). You've decided that you're okay with maximizing cultural output to increase culture bomb yield, so you crank the up the culture slider to 100%. You've really built the city up and it already has 900 culture. It also has 14 towns within it's production radius. With 4 base commerce, +2 for free speech, +1 for printing press and +1 for financial, this is 8 culture per square, more than the 6 that an artist specialist gives you with sistine chapel, so you leave 14 people on towns for 113 CPT. One of your people is already an artist, and you have the other 7 join him, with sistine, that's another 48 CPT. You've also got assorted buildings: 5 temples (+5), a Library (+2), a Theatre (+3), and 2 monastaries (+4). Add all the numbers up for 175 CPT Of course, you didn't forget the cultural multipliers either: 4 cathedrals and the hermitage, not to mention Free speech, for a 400% bonus. 5 X 175 is 825 CPT. Yowza! Okay, so you send in your Great Artist and erm, detonate him. Every single square in the city radius istantly gets the equivalent of 20 turns of that 825 CPT, including the enemy capital that you are trying to flip. That's 16500. Oh, and since the enemy capital is in the second to outermost ring of your cultural influence, it gets an additional 400 points from that 20 point per turn bonus.[NEWLINE]Now, if you hadn't assigned those artists and cranked you'd only have a base of 20, which, with multipliers, would become a mere 100 CPT. The total sum of 20 turns (with the same 400 bonus points) would be 2400. So, you got 7 times the effect for making a temporary adjustment to your production, which you will now switch back. Basically, you got 7 Great Artists for the price of one by exploiting a hole in the game mechanics. Now, if this doesn't bother your conscience just a wee bit, remind me not to allow you in my house unsupervised.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 3: The English are Revolting[NEWLINE]This following example actually happened in a recent game of mine. In this particular game, the English happened to be one of my neighbors and, as neighbors are wont to do, Viki decided to stick a knife in my back while I was off invading Mali. The main effect of this little skirmish was that I ended up owning one of Viki's cities (Oh, and I called off my invasion of Mali and a few million people died and one of my cities got trashed from pillaging and repeatedly changing hands, but that's not important). Deciding that it wouldn't be worth the trouble to keep up the fight, I negotiated a peace treaty and resumed plotting to crush Mali at my earliest convenience.[NEWLINE]This English city that I had captured was culturally very advanced and was something like 4 or 5 squares from their capital. Looking at the city, I noticed a high probability of revolt, somewhere around 9%. Now, if I had remembered the default 'no city flipping after conquest' setting, I might not have been so concerned, but I was thinking civ3 and I was afraid it was going to revolt back, so I started building culture and sending in more troops. With a garrison of 20 troops, a culture bomb, many buildings, and 29% of the population switched to my nationality, the !@#$% city was still trying to revolt. Several revolts later, I added a bunch of mech infantry and finally got the unrest under control, at which point my next invasion of Mali triggered an unnoticed defensive pact, forcing me to destroy the English as well and gain a domination victory, meaning no more chance of revolt, so all my anti-unrest measures were a waste of time anyway.[NEWLINE]Anyway, let's see what was going on. Sometime in the renaissance era (Most players were Industrial, but remember, the era is the players' average era, rounded down) the city had a population of 14 and 4 of the 8 surrounding squares were still under english cultural control. So, multiply the population by 2 and the squares by 4 (renaissance being the 4th era) and we get a base revolt power of 44. Given that 29% of the city was my nationality, we multiply this by 1.59 (this is the approximate result of the nationality ratio equation given above), giving 69. In the interests of diplomacy, I had no state religion, while the city contained Elizabeth's state religion, Confusianism. In fact, it was the Confusian holy city, but this doesn't give any bonuses. Still, her state religion doubles her revolt power. Anyway, we get a revolt power of 138. Okay, the garrison at this point consists of 4 archers, 9 longbows, 1 horse archer, 2 grenadiers and 4 infantry. Add up the numbers and add 1 and we get 130. Hmm. All those troops aren't quite enough. Now maybe if I had a state religion or could've gotten Elizabeth to drop hers, I'd have had an easier time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 4: Modding Fun[NEWLINE]The Mod "FallFromHeaven100" (not to be confused with "FallFromHeaven200", which is too big for my modem, so I've never tried it) contains an interesting take on the missionary unit. Not only is it a medic I combat unit, at least some of the missionary units have the ability to create a tiny great work of art. 20 points of culture, to be exact. Now the intention of this unit was probably to allow a player to throw some quick culture in and get at least 1 culture level and stop any revolt in progress. However, due to the underlying cultural formula, this still gives 20 turns of culture to every square in the city's cultural radius. Not only that, unlike the rare and hard to acquire Great Artist, you can build these guys cheaply in whatever numbers your cities can produce. Of course, while you're busy dropping a mini culture bomb every turn or two, your enemies will be busy outteching your economic mess of a civilization. It can be a bit uncool when the enemy walks over your borders with heavy crossbowmen (power 13) while you're still using archers (power 3, just like standard civ).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of information:[NEWLINE]Most information given here was acquired by reading the source code in the civ4 SDK, available from Firaxis. The culture functions are contained in the files "CvCity.cpp" and "CvPlot.cpp". "CvUnit.cpp" contains the code for great people.[NEWLINE]A number of game values can also be ascertained (or modified) by reading the files in the Assets/XML directory, even if you do not have the SDK. Many of the numbers used in the culture source code are found in GlobalDefines.xml. Units/Civ4UnitInfos.xml contains various unit statistics, including cultural garrison power and great work value. If you do decide to modify the xml, be sure to keep a backup and if possible, figure out how to put your changes in your customassets folder, leaving the original one unmodified. I have no idea how to go about this, as I've never felt the need to actually modify any of the game's values.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Culture Mechanics Disassembled[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Deranged Duck[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE](Please note that all information given here is in regards to Vanilla Civ 1.61. It is probably unchanged in Warlords and the as yet unpublished Beyond the Sword expansion, but I have no way of being certain.)[NEWLINE](Also note that the following information will generally refer to normal speed games, unless otherwise noted. For games played on the Epic, Marathon, or Quick settings, some numbers listed below may be scaled somewhat.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several different values associated with culture in Civilization 4.[NEWLINE]First of all, there is the 'City Culture'. City culture actually affects only one thing: the city's cultural level and thus cultural radius. The city's cultural level and cultural radius start at '1'. When city culture reaches 10, the cultural level goes up to '2'. At 100, it goes up to '3', at 500 it reaches '4', at 5000, it reaches '5', and finally at 50,000 city culture it jumps up to '6', called "Legendary culture". Get 3 cities of level 6 and you win a cultural victory. Also note that a city actually has a cultural value and cultural radius for every player in the game. However, unless a player has actually owned a city at some point, their culture for that city is zero. If they are not the current owner of the city, their city culture will have zero impact on the game. City culture never goes away unless the city is destroyed, or the civilization to whom the culture belongs is destroyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course you were probably already familiar with 'City culture'. If not, you may need to actually go out and buy a copy of Civ 4 and play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is also a less accessible culture value, which I will call the 'plot culture'. Every square/tile/plot/whatever in the game also has a cultural value for every single player. You can't ever see the exact value, but it's not totally invisible. On the city screen, the relative values of 'plot culture' for various players are shown in the city screen if you point the mouse at the 'nationality' bar. If you point the mouse cursor at a square near a city, the %nationality of the plot owner(but nobody else) is shown.[NEWLINE]The main effect of plot culture is to determine whose civilization controls that particular plot of land. A civilization will own a plot, if at least one of its cities has that plot within its cultural radius, and if their plot culture is greater than any other civilization that has that plot within one of their cities' radii. Note that they have to actually own the city. If they built some culture in a city, but later lost control of that city, that city won't allow them to control any of the surrounding tiles. However, the culture that the city spilled onto the surrounding tiles might allow another of their cities to control those tiles. The exception to all this is plots containing cities. The city and the plot underneath will remain under the control of whoever founded or last conquered it, regardless of underlying culture. However, if the calculated cultural owner is different from the city owner (in other words, some other city, belonging to a different player has the plot within its cultural radius, and they have more culture on that plot), there is a chance of the city revolting and changing sides. We'll go into revolts in more detail later. Finally, note that plot culture can never ever be gotten rid of, except in a couple of circumstances. Firstly, if you give away a city, you lose all plot cultire in the city square and surrounding 8 squares. Secondly, if you completely obliterate a civilization, their plot culture goes away. Still, if a civilization owns no cities in an area, their culture won't have any effect except to alter the displayed nationality of squares in the region and to cause a small amount of unhappiness in cities who "long to join the motherland".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are probably wondering now where all these cultural values are coming from. The city culture is pretty easy, since the city screen clearly shows what all the sources of culture are. All the various temples, libraries, specialists, culture from the cultural slider, and culture from production are added up and then multiplied by the bonuses given by cathedrals, wonders, civics, and so on. This value, sometimes called CPT(Culture Per Turn), is added to the city's culture each and every turn. If this gives the city enough culture to increase it's cultural level and radius, these will also be increased.[NEWLINE]The city's CPT is also added to the plot culture of every plot within the city's cultural radius, regardless of ownership or presence or absence of other cities. However, there's an added factor based on the city's cultural radius. If the distance between the plot and the city is less than the cultural radius, then 20 times the difference is added to the plot culture as well. Note that the square that the city is on counts as being 1 space away and that this 20 value is not scaled with regards to game mode. It is always 20 per turn, period.[NEWLINE]To make sure that that's clear, let me describe it another way. Think of the city's potential cultural area as a series of rings. The first ring consists of the city and the 8 surrounding squares. The second ring contains the other 12 squares of the city's production area, and so on. When the city's cultural level is 1, only the first ring gets the points from the city's CPT. When the city's cultural level reaches 2, both first and second ring get the base CPT and the first ring also gets and additional 20 points a turn, even if the city isn't generating any culture at that time. When the city reaches it's third cultural expansion, The inner 9 squares get an extra 40 points, the next ring gets 20 points and so on. At the highest level of culture, the inner ring gets a whopping 100 extra points of plot culture per turn.[NEWLINE]When you found a city, you also get some plot culture to allow you to control the surrounding area, specifically 2 points on the city square and 1 point in the surrounding 8 squares. This is why newly founded cities are so easy to culturally overwhelm. All you need is a few turns of an obelisk and you've got a majority of culture in your neighbor's city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One last source of culture is the great artist. When added as an artist superspecialist, he merely contributes to the city's cultural (and science) production like any other specialist. However, when the artist is used to create a great work (often called a 'culture bomb'), it gets interesting. Of course, the 4000 culture points are instantly added to the city's culture. Guess how many of those 4000 points are added to the plot culture of the surrounding squares. The answer is zero. Of course, those familiar with culture bombing will be surprised by this, because they will remember using great works to take control of territory as well boost the city culture, so clearly something more complex is going on. Here's what actually happens:[NEWLINE]First, the city is brought out of revolt, if it is currently revolting. Then, the 4000 points (or whatever the value of the great artist happens to be) is broken up into 20 equal groups. The first group is added to the city's culture. The city's cultural level and radius are recalculated. Then, one turn worth of the city's current cultural output is added to the surrounding squares, including the 20 point bonus for each ring below the outermost ring. Repeat this process for the other 19 groups of great work culture.[NEWLINE]So, let's walk through what this does. Suppose a great artist creates a great work in a city that has no culture.

This brings the city's cultural level to 4, where it will stay for the remainder of the cultural delivery as we're only giving 4000 points and it needs 5000 for the next level. So, the innermost ring gets 60 culture each of 18 times, the next ring gets 40 culture 18 times, and the third ring gets 20 culture 18 times. Or, to sum it up, The first ring gets 1160 points of plot culture, the second ring gets 760, the third ring gets 360 and the fourth ring, although within the city's cultural radius gets nothing. This may seem like a lot, but consider if you sat on the city for a mere 20 turns, you'd double it. Of course, if the city also had any cultural production, that amount would be delivered 20 times to every square in the first 3 rings, and 18 times to the fourth ring.[NEWLINE]Note that when the city's culture is delivered, it is the amount that the city produces at that instant, not that turn.

However, if one's goal is to culturally overwhelm the opponents and force their cities to change sides, it becomes an issue, because one might actually want to culture bomb in a huge city with many cultural buildings in order to speed the revolt of a powerful neighboring city. In such games, it might be desireable to impose some sort of a rule, such as needing to leave the artists and culture slider there for 1 turn, or not being allowed to crank up culture at all, prior to bombing.

But, do whatever you find fun. It's not like I care how you play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, let's move on to the topic of revolts. A revolt in a city can occur if the owner of the city and the person who would own the underlying square if there were no city are different. In other words, a city might revolt if a neighboring city belonging to a different civilization has it within its cultural radius and that civilization's plot culture under the city is greater than the city's owner and that of all other civilizations with a city in range. You don't have to have a majority, you just have to have more of your nationality than the other guy. If a revolt can occur, there is a flat 10% chance each turn of making a revolt check.[NEWLINE]During a revolt check, a random number between 0 and the city's revolt power is compared with the garrison strength. If the number is greater than the garrison strength, the city revolts. Barbarian cities always fail this check, so will always revolt. If a city revolts there are several effects. All units in the city lose half their current hit points, the city's cultural radius becomes 0 and it produces nothing for a certain number of turns.

The only catch is that cultural garrison strength can't be found in game, so here is a list of unit values:[NEWLINE]warrior, quecha: 3[NEWLINE]archer, skirmisher, axe, spear, phalanx, chariot, immortal, catapult: 4[NEWLINE]swordsman, jaguar, praetorian, horsearcher, keshik, war elephant: 5[NEWLINE]mace, samurai, pike, longbow, crossbow, chokonu, knight, camelarcher, conquistador: 6[NEWLINE]musketman, musketeer, grenadier, cannon: 7[NEWLINE]rifle, redcoat, calvalry, cossack: 8[NEWLINE]machine gun: 9[NEWLINE]infantry, SAM infantry, gunship, artillery: 10[NEWLINE]marine, SEAL, tank, panzer: 12[NEWLINE]mech infantry, modern armor: 16[NEWLINE]Note that ships, planes, workers, great people, and other non-military or non-land units don't help keep a city under control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, now that all that stuff above has been covered, let's give some actual examples, so you can see what it means:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 1: Low culture capital[NEWLINE]Consider a capital city with just a palace and no other cultural buildings. Suppose that the owner just sits there and builds no cultural buildings for 200 turns. How would this work out? Well, the palace produces 2 culture per turn, so at the start, the 9 initial city squares are going to get that amount for 5 turns (total 10), when the cultural radius expands. For the next 45 turns, the first two rings would be getting that 2 CPT and the inner ring would get an extra 20 per turn. Then the Radius expands and for the next 150 turns, the 3 city rings all get 2 culture, with the outer getting 20 extra and the inner getting 40 extra. So, let's add this up. The city of course would end up at radius 3 with a flat 400 culture. The third ring would get a modest 300 points of plot culture, not too hard to invade. The second ring would get 3390. The inner ring, including the city square would get a whopping 7300. For another civ to get a majority in the area, they would need to beat that. If they took the city and just started culture bombing, they'd need around 6 great artists to gain that majority, unless of course they put some more culture in the city. The lesson? Sitting on a spot for a long time counts a lot with regards to cultural control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 2: Cultural Nuke[NEWLINE]Okay, suppose you've got a city that you've got a city that you've built up culturally, in order to flip an enemy capital, say, the city in the previous example, which is 3 squares away, the minimum distance between 2 cities on the same landmass (cities on different landmasses can be 2 squares away, oddly enough). You've decided that you're okay with maximizing cultural output to increase culture bomb yield, so you crank the up the culture slider to 100%. You've really built the city up and it already has 900 culture. It also has 14 towns within it's production radius. With 4 base commerce, +2 for free speech, +1 for printing press and +1 for financial, this is 8 culture per square, more than the 6 that an artist specialist gives you with sistine chapel, so you leave 14 people on towns for 113 CPT. One of your people is already an artist, and you have the other 7 join him, with sistine, that's another 48 CPT. You've also got assorted buildings: 5 temples (+5), a Library (+2), a Theatre (+3), and 2 monastaries (+4). Add all the numbers up for 175 CPT Of course, you didn't forget the cultural multipliers either: 4 cathedrals and the hermitage, not to mention Free speech, for a 400% bonus. 5 X 175 is 825 CPT. Yowza! Okay, so you send in your Great Artist and erm, detonate him. Every single square in the city radius istantly gets the equivalent of 20 turns of that 825 CPT, including the enemy capital that you are trying to flip. That's 16500. Oh, and since the enemy capital is in the second to outermost ring of your cultural influence, it gets an additional 400 points from that 20 point per turn bonus.[NEWLINE]Now, if you hadn't assigned those artists and cranked you'd only have a base of 20, which, with multipliers, would become a mere 100 CPT. The total sum of 20 turns (with the same 400 bonus points) would be 2400. So, you got 7 times the effect for making a temporary adjustment to your production, which you will now switch back. Basically, you got 7 Great Artists for the price of one by exploiting a hole in the game mechanics. Now, if this doesn't bother your conscience just a wee bit, remind me not to allow you in my house unsupervised.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 3: The English are Revolting[NEWLINE]This following example actually happened in a recent game of mine. In this particular game, the English happened to be one of my neighbors and, as neighbors are wont to do, Viki decided to stick a knife in my back while I was off invading Mali. The main effect of this little skirmish was that I ended up owning one of Viki's cities (Oh, and I called off my invasion of Mali and a few million people died and one of my cities got trashed from pillaging and repeatedly changing hands, but that's not important). Deciding that it wouldn't be worth the trouble to keep up the fight, I negotiated a peace treaty and resumed plotting to crush Mali at my earliest convenience.[NEWLINE]This English city that I had captured was culturally very advanced and was something like 4 or 5 squares from their capital. Looking at the city, I noticed a high probability of revolt, somewhere around 9%. Now, if I had remembered the default 'no city flipping after conquest' setting, I might not have been so concerned, but I was thinking civ3 and I was afraid it was going to revolt back, so I started building culture and sending in more troops. With a garrison of 20 troops, a culture bomb, many buildings, and 29% of the population switched to my nationality, the !@#$% city was still trying to revolt. Several revolts later, I added a bunch of mech infantry and finally got the unrest under control, at which point my next invasion of Mali triggered an unnoticed defensive pact, forcing me to destroy the English as well and gain a domination victory, meaning no more chance of revolt, so all my anti-unrest measures were a waste of time anyway.[NEWLINE]Anyway, let's see what was going on. Sometime in the renaissance era (Most players were Industrial, but remember, the era is the players' average era, rounded down) the city had a population of 14 and 4 of the 8 surrounding squares were still under english cultural control. So, multiply the population by 2 and the squares by 4 (renaissance being the 4th era) and we get a base revolt power of 44. Given that 29% of the city was my nationality, we multiply this by 1.59 (this is the approximate result of the nationality ratio equation given above), giving 69. In the interests of diplomacy, I had no state religion, while the city contained Elizabeth's state religion, Confusianism. In fact, it was the Confusian holy city, but this doesn't give any bonuses. Still, her state religion doubles her revolt power. Anyway, we get a revolt power of 138. Okay, the garrison at this point consists of 4 archers, 9 longbows, 1 horse archer, 2 grenadiers and 4 infantry. Add up the numbers and add 1 and we get 130. Hmm. All those troops aren't quite enough. Now maybe if I had a state religion or could've gotten Elizabeth to drop hers, I'd have had an easier time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 4: Modding Fun[NEWLINE]The Mod "FallFromHeaven100" (not to be confused with "FallFromHeaven200", which is too big for my modem, so I've never tried it) contains an interesting take on the missionary unit. Not only is it a medic I combat unit, at least some of the missionary units have the ability to create a tiny great work of art. 20 points of culture, to be exact. Now the intention of this unit was probably to allow a player to throw some quick culture in and get at least 1 culture level and stop any revolt in progress. However, due to the underlying cultural formula, this still gives 20 turns of culture to every square in the city's cultural radius. Not only that, unlike the rare and hard to acquire Great Artist, you can build these guys cheaply in whatever numbers your cities can produce. Of course, while you're busy dropping a mini culture bomb every turn or two, your enemies will be busy outteching your economic mess of a civilization. It can be a bit uncool when the enemy walks over your borders with heavy crossbowmen (power 13) while you're still using archers (power 3, just like standard civ).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of information:[NEWLINE]Most information given here was acquired by reading the source code in the civ4 SDK, available from Firaxis. The culture functions are contained in the files "CvCity.cpp" and "CvPlot.cpp". "CvUnit.cpp" contains the code for great people.[NEWLINE]A number of game values can also be ascertained (or modified) by reading the files in the Assets/XML directory, even if you do not have the SDK. Many of the numbers used in the culture source code are found in GlobalDefines.xml. Units/Civ4UnitInfos.xml contains various unit statistics, including cultural garrison power and great work value. If you do decide to modify the xml, be sure to keep a backup and if possible, figure out how to put your changes in your customassets folder, leaving the original one unmodified. I have no idea how to go about this, as I've never felt the need to actually modify any of the game's values.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Culture Mechanics Disassembled[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Deranged Duck[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE](Please note that all information given here is in regards to Vanilla Civ 1.61. It is probably unchanged in Warlords and the as yet unpublished Beyond the Sword expansion, but I have no way of being certain.)[NEWLINE](Also note that the following information will generally refer to normal speed games, unless otherwise noted. For games played on the Epic, Marathon, or Quick settings, some numbers listed below may be scaled somewhat.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several different values associated with culture in Civilization 4.[NEWLINE]First of all, there is the 'City Culture'. City culture actually affects only one thing: the city's cultural level and thus cultural radius. The city's cultural level and cultural radius start at '1'. When city culture reaches 10, the cultural level goes up to '2'. At 100, it goes up to '3', at 500 it reaches '4', at 5000, it reaches '5', and finally at 50,000 city culture it jumps up to '6', called "Legendary culture". Get 3 cities of level 6 and you win a cultural victory. Also note that a city actually has a cultural value and cultural radius for every player in the game. However, unless a player has actually owned a city at some point, their culture for that city is zero. If they are not the current owner of the city, their city culture will have zero impact on the game. City culture never goes away unless the city is destroyed, or the civilization to whom the culture belongs is destroyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of course you were probably already familiar with 'City culture'. If not, you may need to actually go out and buy a copy of Civ 4 and play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is also a less accessible culture value, which I will call the 'plot culture'. Every square/tile/plot/whatever in the game also has a cultural value for every single player. You can't ever see the exact value, but it's not totally invisible. On the city screen, the relative values of 'plot culture' for various players are shown in the city screen if you point the mouse at the 'nationality' bar. If you point the mouse cursor at a square near a city, the %nationality of the plot owner(but nobody else) is shown.[NEWLINE]The main effect of plot culture is to determine whose civilization controls that particular plot of land. A civilization will own a plot, if at least one of its cities has that plot within its cultural radius, and if their plot culture is greater than any other civilization that has that plot within one of their cities' radii. Note that they have to actually own the city. If they built some culture in a city, but later lost control of that city, that city won't allow them to control any of the surrounding tiles. However, the culture that the city spilled onto the surrounding tiles might allow another of their cities to control those tiles. The exception to all this is plots containing cities. The city and the plot underneath will remain under the control of whoever founded or last conquered it, regardless of underlying culture. However, if the calculated cultural owner is different from the city owner (in other words, some other city, belonging to a different player has the plot within its cultural radius, and they have more culture on that plot), there is a chance of the city revolting and changing sides. We'll go into revolts in more detail later. Finally, note that plot culture can never ever be gotten rid of, except in a couple of circumstances. Firstly, if you give away a city, you lose all plot cultire in the city square and surrounding 8 squares. Secondly, if you completely obliterate a civilization, their plot culture goes away. Still, if a civilization owns no cities in an area, their culture won't have any effect except to alter the displayed nationality of squares in the region and to cause a small amount of unhappiness in cities who "long to join the motherland".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are probably wondering now where all these cultural values are coming from. The city culture is pretty easy, since the city screen clearly shows what all the sources of culture are. All the various temples, libraries, specialists, culture from the cultural slider, and culture from production are added up and then multiplied by the bonuses given by cathedrals, wonders, civics, and so on. This value, sometimes called CPT(Culture Per Turn), is added to the city's culture each and every turn. If this gives the city enough culture to increase it's cultural level and radius, these will also be increased.[NEWLINE]The city's CPT is also added to the plot culture of every plot within the city's cultural radius, regardless of ownership or presence or absence of other cities. However, there's an added factor based on the city's cultural radius. If the distance between the plot and the city is less than the cultural radius, then 20 times the difference is added to the plot culture as well. Note that the square that the city is on counts as being 1 space away and that this 20 value is not scaled with regards to game mode. It is always 20 per turn, period.[NEWLINE]To make sure that that's clear, let me describe it another way. Think of the city's potential cultural area as a series of rings. The first ring consists of the city and the 8 surrounding squares. The second ring contains the other 12 squares of the city's production area, and so on. When the city's cultural level is 1, only the first ring gets the points from the city's CPT. When the city's cultural level reaches 2, both first and second ring get the base CPT and the first ring also gets and additional 20 points a turn, even if the city isn't generating any culture at that time. When the city reaches it's third cultural expansion, The inner 9 squares get an extra 40 points, the next ring gets 20 points and so on. At the highest level of culture, the inner ring gets a whopping 100 extra points of plot culture per turn.[NEWLINE]When you found a city, you also get some plot culture to allow you to control the surrounding area, specifically 2 points on the city square and 1 point in the surrounding 8 squares. This is why newly founded cities are so easy to culturally overwhelm. All you need is a few turns of an obelisk and you've got a majority of culture in your neighbor's city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One last source of culture is the great artist. When added as an artist superspecialist, he merely contributes to the city's cultural (and science) production like any other specialist. However, when the artist is used to create a great work (often called a 'culture bomb'), it gets interesting. Of course, the 4000 culture points are instantly added to the city's culture. Guess how many of those 4000 points are added to the plot culture of the surrounding squares. The answer is zero. Of course, those familiar with culture bombing will be surprised by this, because they will remember using great works to take control of territory as well boost the city culture, so clearly something more complex is going on. Here's what actually happens:[NEWLINE]First, the city is brought out of revolt, if it is currently revolting. Then, the 4000 points (or whatever the value of the great artist happens to be) is broken up into 20 equal groups. The first group is added to the city's culture. The city's cultural level and radius are recalculated. Then, one turn worth of the city's current cultural output is added to the surrounding squares, including the 20 point bonus for each ring below the outermost ring. Repeat this process for the other 19 groups of great work culture.[NEWLINE]So, let's walk through what this does. Suppose a great artist creates a great work in a city that has no culture. The first of the 200 point groups of culture is added. This brings the city's culture level immediately up to 3. Now, although a turn worth of the city's culture is now delivered, the city has no culture and is producing no culture. So, the only plot culture gained is from those 20 point bonuses. The city plot and 8 surrounding squares thus get 40 points of plot culture. The next ring gets only 20 points in each square. Now, we repeat. The next 200 points is added. City's cultural level stays at 3. Same amount added to nearby squares. Third 200 points added. This brings the city's cultural level to 4, where it will stay for the remainder of the cultural delivery as we're only giving 4000 points and it needs 5000 for the next level. So, the innermost ring gets 60 culture each of 18 times, the next ring gets 40 culture 18 times, and the third ring gets 20 culture 18 times. Or, to sum it up, The first ring gets 1160 points of plot culture, the second ring gets 760, the third ring gets 360 and the fourth ring, although within the city's cultural radius gets nothing. This may seem like a lot, but consider if you sat on the city for a mere 20 turns, you'd double it. Of course, if the city also had any cultural production, that amount would be delivered 20 times to every square in the first 3 rings, and 18 times to the fourth ring.[NEWLINE]Note that when the city's culture is delivered, it is the amount that the city produces at that instant, not that turn. This should raise some mental red flags as possibly abusive, because yes, you can set your culture slider to 100, assign everyone to artist specialist, deliver your culture bomb, then set them back before ending your turn. Knowing this, you can get a great deal of benefit at no cost, if you know the trick. Well, actually, there is some cost, because to use this trick to say add another 1000 to all your squares' culture, you'd need first need to build the city up to where it can produce 50 CPT.[NEWLINE]I don't think that this would be a huge issue in most games. Normally a culture bomb would be used to gain minimal immediate control over a contested city. No time to build cultural buildings and not much cultural output anyway. However, if one's goal is to culturally overwhelm the opponents and force their cities to change sides, it becomes an issue, because one might actually want to culture bomb in a huge city with many cultural buildings in order to speed the revolt of a powerful neighboring city. In such games, it might be desireable to impose some sort of a rule, such as needing to leave the artists and culture slider there for 1 turn, or not being allowed to crank up culture at all, prior to bombing. Perhaps even being required to minimize rather than maximize cultural output prior to bomb. Of course, you could just add it to the list of strange things you might need to do to win a culture war game, along with clearing out large garrisons with helicopters and such. But, do whatever you find fun. It's not like I care how you play the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, let's move on to the topic of revolts. A revolt in a city can occur if the owner of the city and the person who would own the underlying square if there were no city are different. In other words, a city might revolt if a neighboring city belonging to a different civilization has it within its cultural radius and that civilization's plot culture under the city is greater than the city's owner and that of all other civilizations with a city in range. You don't have to have a majority, you just have to have more of your nationality than the other guy. If a revolt can occur, there is a flat 10% chance each turn of making a revolt check.[NEWLINE]During a revolt check, a random number between 0 and the city's revolt power is compared with the garrison strength. If the number is greater than the garrison strength, the city revolts. Barbarian cities always fail this check, so will always revolt. If a city revolts there are several effects. All units in the city lose half their current hit points, the city's cultural radius becomes 0 and it produces nothing for a certain number of turns. Also, there is a possibility that the city may change sides (called a flip). A barbarian city will always flip, period. A non barbarian city won't flip if this is the first revolt (there is always one warning revolt). It also won't flip if the option "no city flipping" is on (this by default is off). It won't flip back to someone who has previously owned it, regardless of reason for ownership change, unless the game option "city flipping after conquest" is enabled (this is by default off). If a city flips, all units belonging to enemies of the new owner are destroyed. If the units aren't at war with the new owner, they simply get expelled unless the new owner has open borders with the units' owner.[NEWLINE]So, how is revolt power calculated? The base revolt power starts at 1 and then two factors are added. The first is 2x the city's highest ever population. The second is the number of directly adjacent squares that the revolting people's civilization controls times the current game era. Current game era is considered to be the average era of the remaining players, rounded down, with ancient being considered '1', medieval '2', and so on. So, in the final era (6), if the side the city wants to revolt for controls all 8 squares around the city, this could be as high as 48.[NEWLINE]The base revolt power is then multiplied by several factors. The first is the ratio of the two sides' plot culture for the city square. The formula for this multiplier is 1 + ((revoltCulture - cityOwnerCulture) / (revoltCulture)). This would be a number between 1 and 2, being near 2 if the revolt's plot culture is much higher than the owner, and being near 1 if the two are almost equal. If the revolt's plot culture is twice that of the city owner (i.e., 67% revolting nationality, 33% owner nationality), the value would be about 1.5. Sorry for the ugly math, but I can't find a way to explain it more simply at the moment.[NEWLINE]Fortunatly, the other multipliers are a bit simpler. If the revolting civilization's state religion is present, the value is doubled. If the city owner's state religion is present, the value is halved. If both are present, these two multipliers cancel each other out. If somebody doesn't have a state religion, they don't get a multiplier.[NEWLINE]The city's garrison strength is also simple. Start at 1 and add the cultural garrison strength of all units in the city, regardless of ownership. Double this if the owner and revolting civilization are at war. The only catch is that cultural garrison strength can't be found in game, so here is a list of unit values:[NEWLINE]warrior, quecha: 3[NEWLINE]archer, skirmisher, axe, spear, phalanx, chariot, immortal, catapult: 4[NEWLINE]swordsman, jaguar, praetorian, horsearcher, keshik, war elephant: 5[NEWLINE]mace, samurai, pike, longbow, crossbow, chokonu, knight, camelarcher, conquistador: 6[NEWLINE]musketman, musketeer, grenadier, cannon: 7[NEWLINE]rifle, redcoat, calvalry, cossack: 8[NEWLINE]machine gun: 9[NEWLINE]infantry, SAM infantry, gunship, artillery: 10[NEWLINE]marine, SEAL, tank, panzer: 12[NEWLINE]mech infantry, modern armor: 16[NEWLINE]Note that ships, planes, workers, great people, and other non-military or non-land units don't help keep a city under control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Okay, now that all that stuff above has been covered, let's give some actual examples, so you can see what it means:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 1: Low culture capital[NEWLINE]Consider a capital city with just a palace and no other cultural buildings.

Then the Radius expands and for the next 150 turns, the 3 city rings all get 2 culture, with the outer getting 20 extra and the inner getting 40 extra. So, let's add this up. The city of course would end up at radius 3 with a flat 400 culture. The third ring would get a modest 300 points of plot culture, not too hard to invade. The second ring would get 3390. The inner ring, including the city square would get a whopping 7300. For another civ to get a majority in the area, they would need to beat that. If they took the city and just started culture bombing, they'd need around 6 great artists to gain that majority, unless of course they put some more culture in the city. The lesson? Sitting on a spot for a long time counts a lot with regards to cultural control.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example 2: Cultural Nuke[NEWLINE]Okay, suppose you've got a city that you've got a city that you've built up culturally, in order to flip an enemy capital, say, the city in the previous example, which is 3 squares away, the minimum distance between 2 cities on the same landmass (cities on different landmasses can be 2 squares away, oddly enough).

Of course, while you're busy dropping a mini culture bomb every turn or two, your enemies will be busy outteching your economic mess of a civilization. It can be a bit uncool when the enemy walks over your borders with heavy crossbowmen (power 13) while you're still using archers (power 3, just like standard civ).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of information:[NEWLINE]Most information given here was acquired by reading the source code in the civ4 SDK, available from Firaxis. The culture functions are contained in the files "CvCity.cpp" and "CvPlot.cpp". "CvUnit.cpp" contains the code for great people.[NEWLINE]A number of game values can also be ascertained (or modified) by reading the files in the Assets/XML directory, even if you do not have the SDK. Many of the numbers used in the culture source code are found in GlobalDefines.xml. Units/Civ4UnitInfos.xml contains various unit statistics, including cultural garrison power and great work value. If you do decide to modify the xml, be sure to keep a backup and if possible, figure out how to put your changes in your customassets folder, leaving the original one unmodified. I have no idea how to go about this, as I've never felt the need to actually modify any of the game's values.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Explaining the Vassal System[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Crighton[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I've written the following in an attempt to help explain the Vassal System in the CIV: Warlords expansion.It may not be the most comprehensive explanation possible, but I hope it helps answer some of the many recurring questions which pop up in threads throughout the forums.Please feel free to add to or whatever in posts following.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Good Hunting.[NEWLINE]~Crighton[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Warlords expansion introduces a new diplomatic option called Vassal State. Vassal states are like an "asymmetric alliance" between two Civs.Basically, one civilization serves as the master in the relationship and collects tribute from the weaker, vassal nation.After the discovery of Feudalism the Vassal State option becomes available in the Diplomacy menu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two ways to acquire a vassal state, [BOLD]voluntary[\BOLD] Vassal-ing, and [BOLD]Non-voluntary ([BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD])[\BOLD] Vassal-ing.The second acquisition method is more common, basically consisting of skull-thumping another Civ until it cries "uncle" and begs for mercy.At which point the losing Civ Capitulates to the winning Civ sacrificing it's independence for mere survival and a chance (usually small) at one day regaining independence.A Vassal State that has [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] does not get the option to voluntarily end the Vassal agreement unless certain conditions are met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The less common method occurs during peacetime where a relatively small and weak Civ tries to partner up with a much more powerful Civ, and in exchange for protection agrees to become a Vassal State.A Civ which becomes a Vassal State during peace time is given the opportunity every 10 turns to end the agreement.Throughout long and turbulent games some states may routinely enter into and out of being a Vassal State frequently.When a Voluntary Vassal decides to secede the Master Civ is given the option of simply allowing the Vassal State to become independent, or can choose to protest this decision, in which case both states then become locked in a state of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In both cases, a Vassal State may choose to break the Vassal agreement when any of the three following conditions occur:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 1:[\BOLD] The Vassal State looses more than half of it's territory that it owned at the time it became a Vassal State.For example: Monty become your Vassal and has 4 cities when he becomes your Vassal.Over time Monty grows his Civ to 8 cities total.If Monty looses 4 of his cities through war or culture flipping, he still has 4 cities left and cannot break the agreement.If he lost 6 of his 8 cities he will then have lost 50% of his original lands and can then choose to end the agreement (usually with some terse statement about "not being able to protect us.") [BOLD]It should also be noted that if your Vassal looses cities, etc. to [BOLD]YOU[\BOLD] through culture flipping [BOLD]THAT[\BOLD] also counts towards the loss of territory condition[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 2:[\BOLD] The Vassal State grows in size [BOLD]AND[\BOLD] population to a point where it has more than [BOLD]50% of the Master Civ's size AND population[\BOLD].It's important to reiterate that this is a two part condition.[BOLD]BOTH[\BOLD] have to be met in order for this option to become available to the Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 3:[\BOLD]This is a minor possibility which can occur, where the Master demands a particular resource and the Vassal refuses the Masters request, in which case the two states are at war.This does happen, but it hasn't happened to me since I try to eliminate any potential escape route for my new pets.Since the Master can demand any single resource from the Vassal and the Vassal can't refuse this single / first demand it's best to choose the resource carefully, i.e. a strategic resource of some sort.Let's say you're in the classical or medieval era and need your Vassal's horse resource so you demand and take.But later on you somehow lose your source of iron and demand it from your Vassal, he can refuse and break the Vassal agreement. So plan ahead when it comes to your resource requests. And by the way there is nothing to stop you from selling the horse back to your Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Should a Vassal choose to break the agreement due to the above conditions listed above, the Vassals Master may not agree to peaceably allow the Vassal to become independent, in which case a state of war exists between the two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regrettably, [BOLD]there is currently no method to Release a Vassal from your control[\BOLD], so weigh your decision carefully before accepting a Vassal.[This statement is true as of and up to the v2.08 patch, you'd think this would be an obvious feature to include in the game considering it would make things more logically consistent AND reflect actual history, but whatever].Theoretically it is possible to actually aggravate your vassal into refusing a resource demand at which point the Master could then decide to let the Vassal go or go to war with the now ex-Vassal IF the Vassal refuses the resource demand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some basic pro's of acquiring a Vassal:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master enjoys complete freedom of movement in the vassal's territory, including the ability to heal normally in the vassal's territory and use fortifications owned by the vassal. The master can also investigate any vassal city. And as of the v2.08 patch the Master can now Airlift units directly into a Vassal's cities.The Master no longer has to pay supply costs for units inside of the Vassal's lands. However, the Master must agree to an Open Borders agreement with the Vassal in order for the Vassal to move units into and out of the Master's territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master can demand any [BOLD]SINGLE[\BOLD] resource from a vassal, even one that the vassal is using. The vassal has the right to refuse the [BOLD]SECOND[\BOLD] demand but if they do the two states are immediately at war. This can come in handy if your Vassal has the only strategic resource available to you: i.e. Copper, Iron, Horses, Oil, Aluminum, etc. Just remember to plan ahead if the resource will lose it's strategic value (cough horses cough).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master's people enjoy increased happiness. Those in the vassal empire suffer decreased happiness (but frankly who cares about that bit, it only acts as an incentive for the Vassal to purchase luxury goods from the Master to placate the populace and so long as you keep your Vassal under heel then it's his problem).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The vassal can't make war or peace on its own. It immediately adopts the master's war and peace relationships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Half of the vassal's territory and population count towards the master's domination victory AND score. Which can truly speed up a Domination or Conquest win.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*You can rehabilitate your relationship over time with the Vassal Civ through normal diplomatic means, i.e. Open borders, Shared State Religions, Mutual Military Struggle (if battling another Civ), occasional gifts, etc. Also, after the v2.08 patch the Mutual Defense Pact bonus is now added into the diplomatic modifier between you and your vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Downside of having a Vassal(s):[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having vassal cities will incur higher maintenance cost for your own cities. And if someone could find me the actual formula so I can provide a clear example of this I (and anyone else who reads this) would greatly appreciate it.Regardless of what the formula is put some extra thought into your economy to counter any uptick in maintenance costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Other civs may like you a little less when you have a vassal. You will most likely see a [BOLD]-1[\BOLD] Diplomacy Penalty in you relations with other Civ's as they "Fear their Rivals becoming your Vassal."This penalty is somewhat relative to the power of the Vassal-ed Civ.But regardless, if you have 3 Vassal's of even modest power expect a [BOLD]-3[\BOLD] penalty with every other Civ left.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Similarly, a Vassal who has gone around the continent stirring up trouble is not going to be a good choice to become a Voluntary Vassal as the other Civ's will view your patronage as if you were allies.The AI hatred of your Vassal may override their friendly feelings towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Although you can direct what your Vassal researches the Vassal's Master doesn't share in the discovery.So if your vassal somehow manages to acquire some technology you don't have, he doesn't have to share it with you, nor can you compel the Vassal into sharing the tech.This is the complete opposite of the same occurrence during a Permanent Alliance, where the two allies can research different techs and the discoveries are shared between the two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Your Economy: The ONLY thing that Matters:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before you consider whether or not take on a Vassal make sure your house is in order first. Other threads have and will explain the specifics how best to manage or to help guide your economic advancement.I will simply sum things up thusly: If you don't have a strong economy you can't afford to do anything with your empire, let alone acquire someone else's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That being said, the increased maintenance costs to your cities can be negated by a strong economy.Which means you need to develop both your cities and your newly acquire cities as quickly and as best as possible.This also means not going pillaging happy during the conquest.You want the war to be as efficient as possible, end as quickly as possible, and the reconstruction to be just as quick.You want those new cities to become profitable to help further expansion of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The maintenance cost is most pronounced if you acquire Vassal's early (like right after discovery of Feudalism) and when the freshly conquered cities aren't quite back online to being profitable for you.Later wars do tend to negate the increase mainly because both you and your Vassal have stronger economies (usually).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Civ's are a bit more suited to this than others due to their leader traits, Creative (+2 Culture in each city), Financial (+1 Commerce on 2 Commerce plots) and Organized (-50% Empire Maintenance) being the more obvious traits.I mention the Creative trait specifically because it will help push the cultural borders out further &amp; quicker thereby getting cities up to their fat cross potential earlier, very handy when subjugating neighbors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside of the creative trait is that it probably won't be the best idea to Vassal-ize a Creative Civ.Although the Vassal cannot take your city from you, he can surround and overwhelm the city culturally, with near constant riots being the result. The Financial &amp; Organized traits should really speak for themselves on this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Thoughts on the Acquisition of Vassals:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The more vastly more preferable situation is to acquire a Vassal through [BOLD]Capitulation[\BOLD].A Voluntary Vassal will simply leave you at the earliest convenient time, usually the most inconvenient time for you after having driven up your maintenance cost and enjoyed your protection.There may good short term advantages to accepting a voluntary Vassal such as beefing up a combined front to stave off more powerful Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A [BOLD]Capitulated Vassal[\BOLD] is going to have one heck of an uphill challenge to get out from under your thumb.For example; let us assume a situation where all things are equal.Both you and your rival have six cities each, each city has 10 population, all cities are growing at roughly the same population rate.You declare war and conquer three of his cities (including the original capital since it is most likely the choicest morsel in his empire).You now have nine cities under your control to his three.Preferably you have taken what I call his core cities, which are the ones that have been founded the earliest and have since been grown and developed, usually the heart of the empire.In the current example your opponent will most likely have three good and three average cities he's working with, which means it's probably going to be beyond his capabilities to ever breach the 50% of Masters Land AND 50% of Maters Population to be able to break away, especially when you keep the war machine rolling, as illustrated below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities**:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]** This example only shows a static situation, if you acquire the Vassals early enough they can expand over time (preferably filling in scrub areas that you yourself don't want to settle, yet you don't want a rival to settle the area as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Population***:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]90***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]120***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]150***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***This wouldn't be exact since cities lose population after conquest but the concept should be clear at this point.Plus if running the slavery civic you can whip away the unhappiness and crank out some buildings which may have been destroyed during the conquest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And what do you think the odds are that any of the Vassals are going to be able to break away? Slim to none.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leveraging Your Vassal's Properly And Making the Most of Them:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch it was possible to simply sell your excess resources to your Vassal(s) even when the Vassal in question had no Gold Per Turn available.The Vassal would come up with the GPT by lowering it's discretionary spending (on such things as Research or Culture).This created a very lucrative (and historically accurate, I might add) incentive for acquiring Vassals and then basically pimping them out into cash cows. . . .ah the good old days.Anyhoo, since the patch this is no longer a real option, a similar effect can be created using the Aggressive Trading / Subsidies Tactic discussed elsewhere.Regardless, Vassals can still be lucrative in the long run (discussed later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To reiterate an earlier point: when acquiring the Vassal [BOLD]DO NOT[\BOLD] pillage the guy to hell and back, the resources will only have to be re-developed and that takes time you wouldn't otherwise have to spend.Pillage the guy to hell and back when you don't think you can take his cities and you want to just punish the guy for your troubles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*When it comes to the [BOLD]Voluntary Vassals[\BOLD], don't gift them any military techs unless you absolutely have to, and at the same time direct their research away from the military techs.Preferably to some mutually beneficial technology which grants the Vassal the ability to harvest some resource (which if necessary you can then demand the resource from the Vassal at a later time).It's very likely that the Voluntary Vassal will forgo your benevolent leadership and managerial skills at some time and break away in the near future.You don't want to create a situation where you've just helped your now rival leap frog up to military parity with you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*What you [BOLD]DO[\BOLD] want to do is get a properly [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] Civ up to speed so it can be the greatest assistance to you, which may include bestowing some military techs to your new Vassal.Thereby allowing him to jump up militarily (though there is a good argument for quantity rather than quality for the Vassal's military, constantly feeding the enemy Great General points and experience points may serve to come back to haunt you).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*After acquiring your new pet you need to get him on your side, you've already shown him the stick now show him the carrot and try to rehabilitate your relationship with the Vassal.Spread your religion to all his remaining cities and cajole him to convert (We Care For Our Brothers &amp; Sisters of Faith), open up the borders, gift him some defunct resource (preferably a defunct resource like Copper when you have Iron, if he doesn't have either he WILL appreciate the Copper, "Our Trade Relations Have Been . . . ").When you go for your next Vassal you'll get a "Mutual Military Struggle" bonus with the current Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It's not important that your Vassal like you, some never will (Monty can really hold a grudge). What [BOLD]IS[\BOLD] important is that he become and remain useful to you.So why try to cozy up to him? Simple, the earlier you acquire the Vassal the more time he has to spread out and stake claims of his own, which can be a double edged sword.It is entirely possible for the Vassal to become pleased with his master, meet the criteria to break away and yet not do so (in this possible, though low probability example, it is important to remember the sage advice: "[BOLD]You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than just a kind word[\BOLD]."So have some weight to back up your dominance).The AI will take into account your, and your remaining Vassals, strength into account when decision times come around.You can never go wrong with having the largest army you can afford.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, as your Vassal's spread out they develop resources which you otherwise would not, I for instance am not sticking some poor settler out BFA (Alaska) just to get some dang fur or deer resource, let the Vassals do that, anyway, more resources your Vassal has the more he can trade with you mutually benefiting both empires.And if your Vassal is of the same faith as ye he will help spread the Word amongst the heathens, spreading the gospel (and your line of sight and your shrine income and potentially laying the seeds for an easier invasion some turns down the road).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The aggressive Civ's tend to make for your better pets, Monty, Alex, etc. especially since once brought to heel tend maintain high military strength even when not ramping up for war, which means they're usually ready to help skullthump on your behalf.Which can soften up or even better create a second front against your next conquest, keeping enemy resources tied up can be an excellent tactic especially if you ask the Vassal to focus on attacking one specific enemy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*In general terms you are probably going to acquire what's closest to you rather than on the far side of the world.Which is usually for the better since it's easier for someone else to pick off something that's closer to them.Which leads to the next two points on Vassal Strategy:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *1*[\BOLD] Vassals can be used as excellent staging platforms for further invasions.For example: pretend there are three Civs: A,B, and C.All three occupy the same continent and border each other in the same alphabetical order.For the moment lets say Civ B is on good terms with both A and C, A and C however don't like each other and soon go to war, with Civ C capitulating and becoming the Vassal of Civ A.Civ B now has a bigger problem than he did before with two neighbors because now he has no hope of any balance of power to maintain his existence.Civ A now has the ability to launch invasions from both sides of Civ B's empire simultaneously, a tactic the AI does not deal with well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *2*[\BOLD] In the same example above Civ B is as likely to attack Civ A's territory as it to attack Civ A's Vassal (the Old Civ C).This leaves the field wide open for Civ A to invade while Civ B concentrates on Civ C and any Civ A cities conquered from Civ C.Here's the great part, if B does manage to make headway on the Vassal and knock out enough territory to break the Vassal agreement, who cares if the Vassal's cities are getting raised or captured? It's better that the losses consume and distract Civ B's military resources while Civ A rolls on in from the opposite side and forces Civ B to capitulate.All in all Civ A is sitting pretty with all of it's territory and a chunk of Civ B and Civ C's territory, plus some vassals to kick around.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To summarize the above, it's better for your Vassal(s) to take a beating than you.In which case if you're Civ A and Civ B becomes your Vassal keep the fighting in either the occupied territories of Civ B or on Civ C's doorstep.Let Vassal Civ B be both your doormat and your buffer zone.Because remember, that's what Civ B is there for, to eat the bullet so you don't have to.This particular point also illustrates my only successful use of the Machine Gunner, I stuck Combat One and Medic One promoted MG in my Vassal's border cities, I still pity those poor Egyptian Cavalrymen who generously donated 32 units to theGreat General fund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Other Fine Points:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A general piece of Warmongering Advice: the first Civ you meet isn't going to be the best candidate for Vassal-ing.Generally speaking the first Civ you run across is probably going to be your best bet for early elimination and/or outright acquisition.If you're skullthumping your neighbor with early swordsman (or earlier with axmen, warriors, etc.) then you aren't going to be Vassal-ing anybody anyway since you probably haven't got Feudalism.Therefore, if you do go to war finish the other guy off completely, no sense of having some enemy out on the field for the better part of eternity with a grudge just waiting to come back to haunt you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*One of the major points about Vassal's is that an attack on the Vassal is an attack on the Master, which can be quite a disincentive to attack either.The flip side to this is that you can be at peace minding your business when chuckles knocks on your door begging to be your Vassal, and maybe you've been a bit inattentive in monitoring the current state of relations and decided to accept the Vassal.At which point his enemies are now [BOLD]YOUR[\BOLD] enemies thus dragging you into some conflagration you weren't prepared for or desired (of course this could just be the pretext you want for war with the other Civ's being the aggressors instead of you, thereby keeping the old War Weariness down by fighting on home turf as opposed to foreign lands).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch there was a tendency by the AI that when losing a war with the player, the AI would align itself with a Player-"friendly" Civ by becoming a Vassal and then drag a Civ, which the player may have been closely "allied" with, into war against the player. [BOLD]The v2.08 patch did not create some magic rule saying this can no longer happen just that the decision would be more thoughtfully evaluated by the AI[\BOLD]. A good quick, rule of thumb is that one of the factors the AI is going to judge this decision by is: is your military power equal to, less than or significantly greater then, his and his new Vassal's military power. If your "Ally" thinks he could otherwise take you on and come out the better he is going to do it ([BOLD]and let's be blunt, so would you[\BOLD]). Your "[BOLD]Ally[\BOLD]" basically weights the decision like this: "[BOLD]Yeah, I'm friendly with the player, but is this too good an opportunity to pass up[\BOLD]?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It may not be necessary or prudent to accept a Civ's offer of Capitulation the first time it's offered.For example, say you invade an island and take two of three cities, the remaining city being the enemy capital.And the other civ knows he's beat will offer to Capitulate.Don't vassal the civ until AFTER you've taken the capital otherwise the culture war will be a constant irritation in later turns ("[BOLD]An Indian revolt is taking place in Madras...[\BOLD]").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having and acquiring Vassals allows you to run a more precise offense allowing you to cut down dramatically on Domination and Conquest wins.Taking the same six city example from above, let us simply score 1 city as one point and 1 population as 1 point.The first war takes your base of six to nine, a 50% increase in lands directly held to you, plus you get half of your Vassal points (1.5), which in this grossly simplified score gets you a total point score of 10.5 as opposed to 9.The second Vassal would take your base score to 12 points with an additional 3 coming from your Vassals, totaling 15.The third Vassal war would take you to a 15 point base with an additional 4.5 from your Vassals bring the total up to: 19.5. In this case your Vassals are increasing your score by about 30%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[TAB]Vassal 2[TAB]Vassal 3[TAB]Total pts.[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6 / 6pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 pts(+0%)[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9 / 9pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]10.5pts (+16%)[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12 / 12pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]15pts (+25%)[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15 / 15pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pt[TAB]19.5pts (+30%)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not to shabby in my opinion.And this of course neglects any expansion done by the Vassals after Vassalization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To follow up on the preceding point about running a precise offense.The strategy is that if one is able and willing to accept Vassals then the volume of necessary fighting that you'll have to do will be reduced, therefore lowering the costs of the war in time and material. Why waste time conquering an empire of 20 cities if you only have to take the six best ones to impose a favorable peace?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Superpowers and Hyperpowers and General Compaints:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Vassal system turned on, the larger the map and the more Civs in the game, there is a much greater tendency for the formations of [BOLD]Super[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Hyper-powers[\BOLD]. Without the Vassal system you could expect to see a web of Mutual Defense Pacts, even occasionally some Permanent Alliances, for a real life example think back to pre-World War One days with the complicated networking of treaties. But, with the Vassal system you can expect the AI's to cluster together with a strong Civ achieving dominance over one, or several, rival Civs which can be aligned against you. A real life example, the Soviet Union and it's client states during the Cold War. With the Vassal system the same advantages which the player can exploit, can also be exploited by the AI, with the results being a patchwork of regional and super powers developing on the map.Which probably bears some relation to Medieval Europe in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the [BOLD]Hyperpower[\BOLD] situation, you have one Civ with a relatively large expansion of it's own, coupled with not just one or several Vassals, but with a great many Vassal client states, each sufficiently developed in their own right.Hopefully, this is the player being the Hyperpower and not the AI.One can be forgiven for thinking that this would have a chilling effect on wars breaking out, or at least if war did break out it would be the Hyperpower looking to expand.However, this isn't always the case.A regional superpower or even separate (yet diplomatically close) Civs may try to break up the emerging or developing Hyperpower by launching a Pre-Emptive attack.Usually you can expect to see this happen once you start seeing the "You've grown too powerful for us" diplomatic response to even the simplest of trades.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the many frequent complaints about the Vassal system is that it can be a deterrent for warmongering, "I can't attack him without declaring war on his master and other Vassals" etc. etc., usually followed by some comment about the system being "broken." [BOLD]It's not broken, you just don't like the result[\BOLD].I can attest to the aggravation of being sidled up next to an emerging hyper power and not being able to have done anything about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What feels eminently worse though, is when you attack another Civ, take a chunk and declare peace with the intent of re-declaring war after a short respite and chucklehead has gone off and Voluntarily become a Vassal of someone you don't really want to tangle with.[BOLD]Again, it's aggravating but the system isn't broke, we just don't like the outcome[\BOLD].If anything it's working perfectly when your victim does this as he maintains a chance at independence and keeps you from gobbling him up. Cheeky monkey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other major complaint I see cropping up from the Vassal system is that it encourages a Warmongering Strategy at the expense of a "Builder's" strategy (i.e., Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories).Ironically this is pretty much the exact opposite of the above complaint but whatever.If anything it is equally likely that a network of known treaties and Vassals would encourage peacefully strategies, especially if no Civ groupings can think they can take on and prevail against it's rival Civ groupings, thus creating a Cold War situation.As always, you must be prepared for war in order to secure peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An aside: it is the scoring system that is nerfed, not the Vassal system.The scoring system heavily factors Time / Turns Elapsed over Type of victory.Since Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories only become possible in the late game the higher scoring games will come about primarily through War Mongering, a great great many game will end before even the option to score a Diplomatic win becomes available (let alone Space Race).A retuning of the scoring system would clear up most of the "balancing issues" in terms of strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Outsanding Questions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE](For which if someone could locate in the xml's or wherever I would be gratefull to know the answers to)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Maintenance?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Happiness boost to Master?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]References:[NEWLINE]The Civilopedia[NEWLINE]v2.08 Patch info by Thunderfall[NEWLINE]Me</English>

Vassal states are like an "asymmetric alliance" between two Civs.Basically, one civilization serves as the master in the relationship and collects tribute from the weaker, vassal nation.After the discovery of Feudalism the Vassal State option becomes available in the Diplomacy menu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two ways to acquire a vassal state, [BOLD]voluntary[\BOLD] Vassal-ing, and [BOLD]Non-voluntary ([BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD])[\BOLD] Vassal-ing.The second acquisition method is more common, basically consisting of skull-thumping another Civ until it cries "uncle" and begs for mercy.At which point the losing Civ Capitulates to the winning Civ sacrificing it's independence for mere survival and a chance (usually small) at one day regaining independence.A Vassal State that has [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] does not get the option to voluntarily end the Vassal agreement unless certain conditions are met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The less common method occurs during peacetime where a relatively small and weak Civ tries to partner up with a much more powerful Civ, and in exchange for protection agrees to become a Vassal State.A Civ which becomes a Vassal State during peace time is given the opportunity every 10 turns to end the agreement.Throughout long and turbulent games some states may routinely enter into and out of being a Vassal State frequently.When a Voluntary Vassal decides to secede the Master Civ is given the option of simply allowing the Vassal State to become independent, or can choose to protest this decision, in which case both states then become locked in a state of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In both cases, a Vassal State may choose to break the Vassal agreement when any of the three following conditions occur:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 1:[\BOLD] The Vassal State looses more than half of it's territory that it owned at the time it became a Vassal State.For example: Monty become your Vassal and has 4 cities when he becomes your Vassal.Over time Monty grows his Civ to 8 cities total.If Monty looses 4 of his cities through war or culture flipping, he still has 4 cities left and cannot break the agreement.If he lost 6 of his 8 cities he will then have lost 50% of his original lands and can then choose to end the agreement (usually with some terse statement about "not being able to protect us.") [BOLD]It should also be noted that if your Vassal looses cities, etc. to [BOLD]YOU[\BOLD] through culture flipping [BOLD]THAT[\BOLD] also counts towards the loss of territory condition[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 2:[\BOLD] The Vassal State grows in size [BOLD]AND[\BOLD] population to a point where it has more than [BOLD]50% of the Master Civ's size AND population[\BOLD].It's important to reiterate that this is a two part condition.[BOLD]BOTH[\BOLD] have to be met in order for this option to become available to the Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 3:[\BOLD]This is a minor possibility which can occur, where the Master demands a particular resource and the Vassal refuses the Masters request, in which case the two states are at war.This does happen, but it hasn't happened to me since I try to eliminate any potential escape route for my new pets.Since the Master can demand any single resource from the Vassal and the Vassal can't refuse this single / first demand it's best to choose the resource carefully, i.e. a strategic resource of some sort.Let's say you're in the classical or medieval era and need your Vassal's horse resource so you demand and take.But later on you somehow lose your source of iron and demand it from your Vassal, he can refuse and break the Vassal agreement. So plan ahead when it comes to your resource requests. And by the way there is nothing to stop you from selling the horse back to your Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Should a Vassal choose to break the agreement due to the above conditions listed above, the Vassals Master may not agree to peaceably allow the Vassal to become independent, in which case a state of war exists between the two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regrettably, [BOLD]there is currently no method to Release a Vassal from your control[\BOLD], so weigh your decision carefully before accepting a Vassal.[This statement is true as of and up to the v2.08 patch, you'd think this would be an obvious feature to include in the game considering it would make things more logically consistent AND reflect actual history, but whatever].Theoretically it is possible to actually aggravate your vassal into refusing a resource demand at which point the Master could then decide to let the Vassal go or go to war with the now ex-Vassal IF the Vassal refuses the resource demand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some basic pro's of acquiring a Vassal:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master enjoys complete freedom of movement in the vassal's territory, including the ability to heal normally in the vassal's territory and use fortifications owned by the vassal. The master can also investigate any vassal city. And as of the v2.08 patch the Master can now Airlift units directly into a Vassal's cities.The Master no longer has to pay supply costs for units inside of the Vassal's lands. However, the Master must agree to an Open Borders agreement with the Vassal in order for the Vassal to move units into and out of the Master's territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master can demand any [BOLD]SINGLE[\BOLD] resource from a vassal, even one that the vassal is using. The vassal has the right to refuse the [BOLD]SECOND[\BOLD] demand but if they do the two states are immediately at war. This can come in handy if your Vassal has the only strategic resource available to you: i.e. Copper, Iron, Horses, Oil, Aluminum, etc. Just remember to plan ahead if the resource will lose it's strategic value (cough horses cough).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master's people enjoy increased happiness. Those in the vassal empire suffer decreased happiness (but frankly who cares about that bit, it only acts as an incentive for the Vassal to purchase luxury goods from the Master to placate the populace and so long as you keep your Vassal under heel then it's his problem).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The vassal can't make war or peace on its own. It immediately adopts the master's war and peace relationships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Half of the vassal's territory and population count towards the master's domination victory AND score. Which can truly speed up a Domination or Conquest win.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*You can rehabilitate your relationship over time with the Vassal Civ through normal diplomatic means, i.e. Open borders, Shared State Religions, Mutual Military Struggle (if battling another Civ), occasional gifts, etc. Also, after the v2.08 patch the Mutual Defense Pact bonus is now added into the diplomatic modifier between you and your vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Downside of having a Vassal(s):[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having vassal cities will incur higher maintenance cost for your own cities. And if someone could find me the actual formula so I can provide a clear example of this I (and anyone else who reads this) would greatly appreciate it.Regardless of what the formula is put some extra thought into your economy to counter any uptick in maintenance costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Other civs may like you a little less when you have a vassal. You will most likely see a [BOLD]-1[\BOLD] Diplomacy Penalty in you relations with other Civ's as they "Fear their Rivals becoming your Vassal."This penalty is somewhat relative to the power of the Vassal-ed Civ.But regardless, if you have 3 Vassal's of even modest power expect a [BOLD]-3[\BOLD] penalty with every other Civ left.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Similarly, a Vassal who has gone around the continent stirring up trouble is not going to be a good choice to become a Voluntary Vassal as the other Civ's will view your patronage as if you were allies.The AI hatred of your Vassal may override their friendly feelings towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Although you can direct what your Vassal researches the Vassal's Master doesn't share in the discovery.So if your vassal somehow manages to acquire some technology you don't have, he doesn't have to share it with you, nor can you compel the Vassal into sharing the tech.This is the complete opposite of the same occurrence during a Permanent Alliance, where the two allies can research different techs and the discoveries are shared between the two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Your Economy: The ONLY thing that Matters:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before you consider whether or not take on a Vassal make sure your house is in order first. Other threads have and will explain the specifics how best to manage or to help guide your economic advancement.I will simply sum things up thusly: If you don't have a strong economy you can't afford to do anything with your empire, let alone acquire someone else's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That being said, the increased maintenance costs to your cities can be negated by a strong economy.Which means you need to develop both your cities and your newly acquire cities as quickly and as best as possible.This also means not going pillaging happy during the conquest.You want the war to be as efficient as possible, end as quickly as possible, and the reconstruction to be just as quick.You want those new cities to become profitable to help further expansion of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The maintenance cost is most pronounced if you acquire Vassal's early (like right after discovery of Feudalism) and when the freshly conquered cities aren't quite back online to being profitable for you.Later wars do tend to negate the increase mainly because both you and your Vassal have stronger economies (usually).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Civ's are a bit more suited to this than others due to their leader traits, Creative (+2 Culture in each city), Financial (+1 Commerce on 2 Commerce plots) and Organized (-50% Empire Maintenance) being the more obvious traits.I mention the Creative trait specifically because it will help push the cultural borders out further &amp; quicker thereby getting cities up to their fat cross potential earlier, very handy when subjugating neighbors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside of the creative trait is that it probably won't be the best idea to Vassal-ize a Creative Civ.Although the Vassal cannot take your city from you, he can surround and overwhelm the city culturally, with near constant riots being the result. The Financial &amp; Organized traits should really speak for themselves on this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Thoughts on the Acquisition of Vassals:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The more vastly more preferable situation is to acquire a Vassal through [BOLD]Capitulation[\BOLD].A Voluntary Vassal will simply leave you at the earliest convenient time, usually the most inconvenient time for you after having driven up your maintenance cost and enjoyed your protection.There may good short term advantages to accepting a voluntary Vassal such as beefing up a combined front to stave off more powerful Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A [BOLD]Capitulated Vassal[\BOLD] is going to have one heck of an uphill challenge to get out from under your thumb.For example; let us assume a situation where all things are equal.Both you and your rival have six cities each, each city has 10 population, all cities are growing at roughly the same population rate.You declare war and conquer three of his cities (including the original capital since it is most likely the choicest morsel in his empire).You now have nine cities under your control to his three.Preferably you have taken what I call his core cities, which are the ones that have been founded the earliest and have since been grown and developed, usually the heart of the empire.In the current example your opponent will most likely have three good and three average cities he's working with, which means it's probably going to be beyond his capabilities to ever breach the 50% of Masters Land AND 50% of Maters Population to be able to break away, especially when you keep the war machine rolling, as illustrated below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities**:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]** This example only shows a static situation, if you acquire the Vassals early enough they can expand over time (preferably filling in scrub areas that you yourself don't want to settle, yet you don't want a rival to settle the area as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Population***:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]90***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]120***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]150***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***This wouldn't be exact since cities lose population after conquest but the concept should be clear at this point.Plus if running the slavery civic you can whip away the unhappiness and crank out some buildings which may have been destroyed during the conquest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And what do you think the odds are that any of the Vassals are going to be able to break away? Slim to none.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leveraging Your Vassal's Properly And Making the Most of Them:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch it was possible to simply sell your excess resources to your Vassal(s) even when the Vassal in question had no Gold Per Turn available.The Vassal would come up with the GPT by lowering it's discretionary spending (on such things as Research or Culture).This created a very lucrative (and historically accurate, I might add) incentive for acquiring Vassals and then basically pimping them out into cash cows. . . .ah the good old days.Anyhoo, since the patch this is no longer a real option, a similar effect can be created using the Aggressive Trading / Subsidies Tactic discussed elsewhere.Regardless, Vassals can still be lucrative in the long run (discussed later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To reiterate an earlier point: when acquiring the Vassal [BOLD]DO NOT[\BOLD] pillage the guy to hell and back, the resources will only have to be re-developed and that takes time you wouldn't otherwise have to spend.Pillage the guy to hell and back when you don't think you can take his cities and you want to just punish the guy for your troubles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*When it comes to the [BOLD]Voluntary Vassals[\BOLD], don't gift them any military techs unless you absolutely have to, and at the same time direct their research away from the military techs.Preferably to some mutually beneficial technology which grants the Vassal the ability to harvest some resource (which if necessary you can then demand the resource from the Vassal at a later time).It's very likely that the Voluntary Vassal will forgo your benevolent leadership and managerial skills at some time and break away in the near future.You don't want to create a situation where you've just helped your now rival leap frog up to military parity with you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*What you [BOLD]DO[\BOLD] want to do is get a properly [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] Civ up to speed so it can be the greatest assistance to you, which may include bestowing some military techs to your new Vassal.Thereby allowing him to jump up militarily (though there is a good argument for quantity rather than quality for the Vassal's military, constantly feeding the enemy Great General points and experience points may serve to come back to haunt you).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*After acquiring your new pet you need to get him on your side, you've already shown him the stick now show him the carrot and try to rehabilitate your relationship with the Vassal.Spread your religion to all his remaining cities and cajole him to convert (We Care For Our Brothers &amp; Sisters of Faith), open up the borders, gift him some defunct resource (preferably a defunct resource like Copper when you have Iron, if he doesn't have either he WILL appreciate the Copper, "Our Trade Relations Have Been . . . ").When you go for your next Vassal you'll get a "Mutual Military Struggle" bonus with the current Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It's not important that your Vassal like you, some never will (Monty can really hold a grudge). What [BOLD]IS[\BOLD] important is that he become and remain useful to you.So why try to cozy up to him? Simple, the earlier you acquire the Vassal the more time he has to spread out and stake claims of his own, which can be a double edged sword.It is entirely possible for the Vassal to become pleased with his master, meet the criteria to break away and yet not do so (in this possible, though low probability example, it is important to remember the sage advice: "[BOLD]You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than just a kind word[\BOLD]."So have some weight to back up your dominance).The AI will take into account your, and your remaining Vassals, strength into account when decision times come around.You can never go wrong with having the largest army you can afford.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, as your Vassal's spread out they develop resources which you otherwise would not, I for instance am not sticking some poor settler out BFA (Alaska) just to get some dang fur or deer resource, let the Vassals do that, anyway, more resources your Vassal has the more he can trade with you mutually benefiting both empires.And if your Vassal is of the same faith as ye he will help spread the Word amongst the heathens, spreading the gospel (and your line of sight and your shrine income and potentially laying the seeds for an easier invasion some turns down the road).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The aggressive Civ's tend to make for your better pets, Monty, Alex, etc. especially since once brought to heel tend maintain high military strength even when not ramping up for war, which means they're usually ready to help skullthump on your behalf.Which can soften up or even better create a second front against your next conquest, keeping enemy resources tied up can be an excellent tactic especially if you ask the Vassal to focus on attacking one specific enemy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*In general terms you are probably going to acquire what's closest to you rather than on the far side of the world.Which is usually for the better since it's easier for someone else to pick off something that's closer to them.Which leads to the next two points on Vassal Strategy:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *1*[\BOLD] Vassals can be used as excellent staging platforms for further invasions.For example: pretend there are three Civs: A,B, and C.All three occupy the same continent and border each other in the same alphabetical order.For the moment lets say Civ B is on good terms with both A and C, A and C however don't like each other and soon go to war, with Civ C capitulating and becoming the Vassal of Civ A.Civ B now has a bigger problem than he did before with two neighbors because now he has no hope of any balance of power to maintain his existence.Civ A now has the ability to launch invasions from both sides of Civ B's empire simultaneously, a tactic the AI does not deal with well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *2*[\BOLD] In the same example above Civ B is as likely to attack Civ A's territory as it to attack Civ A's Vassal (the Old Civ C).This leaves the field wide open for Civ A to invade while Civ B concentrates on Civ C and any Civ A cities conquered from Civ C.Here's the great part, if B does manage to make headway on the Vassal and knock out enough territory to break the Vassal agreement, who cares if the Vassal's cities are getting raised or captured? It's better that the losses consume and distract Civ B's military resources while Civ A rolls on in from the opposite side and forces Civ B to capitulate.All in all Civ A is sitting pretty with all of it's territory and a chunk of Civ B and Civ C's territory, plus some vassals to kick around.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To summarize the above, it's better for your Vassal(s) to take a beating than you.In which case if you're Civ A and Civ B becomes your Vassal keep the fighting in either the occupied territories of Civ B or on Civ C's doorstep.Let Vassal Civ B be both your doormat and your buffer zone.Because remember, that's what Civ B is there for, to eat the bullet so you don't have to.This particular point also illustrates my only successful use of the Machine Gunner, I stuck Combat One and Medic One promoted MG in my Vassal's border cities, I still pity those poor Egyptian Cavalrymen who generously donated 32 units to theGreat General fund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Other Fine Points:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A general piece of Warmongering Advice: the first Civ you meet isn't going to be the best candidate for Vassal-ing.Generally speaking the first Civ you run across is probably going to be your best bet for early elimination and/or outright acquisition.If you're skullthumping your neighbor with early swordsman (or earlier with axmen, warriors, etc.) then you aren't going to be Vassal-ing anybody anyway since you probably haven't got Feudalism.Therefore, if you do go to war finish the other guy off completely, no sense of having some enemy out on the field for the better part of eternity with a grudge just waiting to come back to haunt you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*One of the major points about Vassal's is that an attack on the Vassal is an attack on the Master, which can be quite a disincentive to attack either.The flip side to this is that you can be at peace minding your business when chuckles knocks on your door begging to be your Vassal, and maybe you've been a bit inattentive in monitoring the current state of relations and decided to accept the Vassal.At which point his enemies are now [BOLD]YOUR[\BOLD] enemies thus dragging you into some conflagration you weren't prepared for or desired (of course this could just be the pretext you want for war with the other Civ's being the aggressors instead of you, thereby keeping the old War Weariness down by fighting on home turf as opposed to foreign lands).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch there was a tendency by the AI that when losing a war with the player, the AI would align itself with a Player-"friendly" Civ by becoming a Vassal and then drag a Civ, which the player may have been closely "allied" with, into war against the player. [BOLD]The v2.08 patch did not create some magic rule saying this can no longer happen just that the decision would be more thoughtfully evaluated by the AI[\BOLD]. A good quick, rule of thumb is that one of the factors the AI is going to judge this decision by is: is your military power equal to, less than or significantly greater then, his and his new Vassal's military power. If your "Ally" thinks he could otherwise take you on and come out the better he is going to do it ([BOLD]and let's be blunt, so would you[\BOLD]). Your "[BOLD]Ally[\BOLD]" basically weights the decision like this: "[BOLD]Yeah, I'm friendly with the player, but is this too good an opportunity to pass up[\BOLD]?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It may not be necessary or prudent to accept a Civ's offer of Capitulation the first time it's offered.For example, say you invade an island and take two of three cities, the remaining city being the enemy capital.And the other civ knows he's beat will offer to Capitulate.Don't vassal the civ until AFTER you've taken the capital otherwise the culture war will be a constant irritation in later turns ("[BOLD]An Indian revolt is taking place in Madras...[\BOLD]").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having and acquiring Vassals allows you to run a more precise offense allowing you to cut down dramatically on Domination and Conquest wins.Taking the same six city example from above, let us simply score 1 city as one point and 1 population as 1 point.The first war takes your base of six to nine, a 50% increase in lands directly held to you, plus you get half of your Vassal points (1.5), which in this grossly simplified score gets you a total point score of 10.5 as opposed to 9.The second Vassal would take your base score to 12 points with an additional 3 coming from your Vassals, totaling 15.The third Vassal war would take you to a 15 point base with an additional 4.5 from your Vassals bring the total up to: 19.5. In this case your Vassals are increasing your score by about 30%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[TAB]Vassal 2[TAB]Vassal 3[TAB]Total pts.[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6 / 6pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 pts(+0%)[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9 / 9pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]10.5pts (+16%)[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12 / 12pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]15pts (+25%)[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15 / 15pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pt[TAB]19.5pts (+30%)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not to shabby in my opinion.And this of course neglects any expansion done by the Vassals after Vassalization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To follow up on the preceding point about running a precise offense.The strategy is that if one is able and willing to accept Vassals then the volume of necessary fighting that you'll have to do will be reduced, therefore lowering the costs of the war in time and material. Why waste time conquering an empire of 20 cities if you only have to take the six best ones to impose a favorable peace?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Superpowers and Hyperpowers and General Compaints:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Vassal system turned on, the larger the map and the more Civs in the game, there is a much greater tendency for the formations of [BOLD]Super[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Hyper-powers[\BOLD]. Without the Vassal system you could expect to see a web of Mutual Defense Pacts, even occasionally some Permanent Alliances, for a real life example think back to pre-World War One days with the complicated networking of treaties. But, with the Vassal system you can expect the AI's to cluster together with a strong Civ achieving dominance over one, or several, rival Civs which can be aligned against you. A real life example, the Soviet Union and it's client states during the Cold War. With the Vassal system the same advantages which the player can exploit, can also be exploited by the AI, with the results being a patchwork of regional and super powers developing on the map.Which probably bears some relation to Medieval Europe in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the [BOLD]Hyperpower[\BOLD] situation, you have one Civ with a relatively large expansion of it's own, coupled with not just one or several Vassals, but with a great many Vassal client states, each sufficiently developed in their own right.Hopefully, this is the player being the Hyperpower and not the AI.One can be forgiven for thinking that this would have a chilling effect on wars breaking out, or at least if war did break out it would be the Hyperpower looking to expand.However, this isn't always the case.A regional superpower or even separate (yet diplomatically close) Civs may try to break up the emerging or developing Hyperpower by launching a Pre-Emptive attack.Usually you can expect to see this happen once you start seeing the "You've grown too powerful for us" diplomatic response to even the simplest of trades.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the many frequent complaints about the Vassal system is that it can be a deterrent for warmongering, "I can't attack him without declaring war on his master and other Vassals" etc. etc., usually followed by some comment about the system being "broken." [BOLD]It's not broken, you just don't like the result[\BOLD].I can attest to the aggravation of being sidled up next to an emerging hyper power and not being able to have done anything about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What feels eminently worse though, is when you attack another Civ, take a chunk and declare peace with the intent of re-declaring war after a short respite and chucklehead has gone off and Voluntarily become a Vassal of someone you don't really want to tangle with.[BOLD]Again, it's aggravating but the system isn't broke, we just don't like the outcome[\BOLD].If anything it's working perfectly when your victim does this as he maintains a chance at independence and keeps you from gobbling him up. Cheeky monkey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other major complaint I see cropping up from the Vassal system is that it encourages a Warmongering Strategy at the expense of a "Builder's" strategy (i.e., Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories).Ironically this is pretty much the exact opposite of the above complaint but whatever.If anything it is equally likely that a network of known treaties and Vassals would encourage peacefully strategies, especially if no Civ groupings can think they can take on and prevail against it's rival Civ groupings, thus creating a Cold War situation.As always, you must be prepared for war in order to secure peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An aside: it is the scoring system that is nerfed, not the Vassal system.The scoring system heavily factors Time / Turns Elapsed over Type of victory.Since Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories only become possible in the late game the higher scoring games will come about primarily through War Mongering, a great great many game will end before even the option to score a Diplomatic win becomes available (let alone Space Race).A retuning of the scoring system would clear up most of the "balancing issues" in terms of strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Outsanding Questions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE](For which if someone could locate in the xml's or wherever I would be gratefull to know the answers to)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Maintenance?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Happiness boost to Master?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]References:[NEWLINE]The Civilopedia[NEWLINE]v2.08 Patch info by Thunderfall[NEWLINE]Me</French>

Vassal states are like an "asymmetric alliance" between two Civs.Basically, one civilization serves as the master in the relationship and collects tribute from the weaker, vassal nation.After the discovery of Feudalism the Vassal State option becomes available in the Diplomacy menu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two ways to acquire a vassal state, [BOLD]voluntary[\BOLD] Vassal-ing, and [BOLD]Non-voluntary ([BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD])[\BOLD] Vassal-ing.The second acquisition method is more common, basically consisting of skull-thumping another Civ until it cries "uncle" and begs for mercy.At which point the losing Civ Capitulates to the winning Civ sacrificing it's independence for mere survival and a chance (usually small) at one day regaining independence.A Vassal State that has [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] does not get the option to voluntarily end the Vassal agreement unless certain conditions are met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The less common method occurs during peacetime where a relatively small and weak Civ tries to partner up with a much more powerful Civ, and in exchange for protection agrees to become a Vassal State.A Civ which becomes a Vassal State during peace time is given the opportunity every 10 turns to end the agreement.Throughout long and turbulent games some states may routinely enter into and out of being a Vassal State frequently.When a Voluntary Vassal decides to secede the Master Civ is given the option of simply allowing the Vassal State to become independent, or can choose to protest this decision, in which case both states then become locked in a state of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In both cases, a Vassal State may choose to break the Vassal agreement when any of the three following conditions occur:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 1:[\BOLD] The Vassal State looses more than half of it's territory that it owned at the time it became a Vassal State.For example: Monty become your Vassal and has 4 cities when he becomes your Vassal.Over time Monty grows his Civ to 8 cities total.If Monty looses 4 of his cities through war or culture flipping, he still has 4 cities left and cannot break the agreement.If he lost 6 of his 8 cities he will then have lost 50% of his original lands and can then choose to end the agreement (usually with some terse statement about "not being able to protect us.") [BOLD]It should also be noted that if your Vassal looses cities, etc. to [BOLD]YOU[\BOLD] through culture flipping [BOLD]THAT[\BOLD] also counts towards the loss of territory condition[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 2:[\BOLD] The Vassal State grows in size [BOLD]AND[\BOLD] population to a point where it has more than [BOLD]50% of the Master Civ's size AND population[\BOLD].It's important to reiterate that this is a two part condition.[BOLD]BOTH[\BOLD] have to be met in order for this option to become available to the Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 3:[\BOLD]This is a minor possibility which can occur, where the Master demands a particular resource and the Vassal refuses the Masters request, in which case the two states are at war.This does happen, but it hasn't happened to me since I try to eliminate any potential escape route for my new pets.Since the Master can demand any single resource from the Vassal and the Vassal can't refuse this single / first demand it's best to choose the resource carefully, i.e. a strategic resource of some sort.Let's say you're in the classical or medieval era and need your Vassal's horse resource so you demand and take.But later on you somehow lose your source of iron and demand it from your Vassal, he can refuse and break the Vassal agreement. So plan ahead when it comes to your resource requests. And by the way there is nothing to stop you from selling the horse back to your Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Should a Vassal choose to break the agreement due to the above conditions listed above, the Vassals Master may not agree to peaceably allow the Vassal to become independent, in which case a state of war exists between the two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regrettably, [BOLD]there is currently no method to Release a Vassal from your control[\BOLD], so weigh your decision carefully before accepting a Vassal.[This statement is true as of and up to the v2.08 patch, you'd think this would be an obvious feature to include in the game considering it would make things more logically consistent AND reflect actual history, but whatever].Theoretically it is possible to actually aggravate your vassal into refusing a resource demand at which point the Master could then decide to let the Vassal go or go to war with the now ex-Vassal IF the Vassal refuses the resource demand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some basic pro's of acquiring a Vassal:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master enjoys complete freedom of movement in the vassal's territory, including the ability to heal normally in the vassal's territory and use fortifications owned by the vassal. The master can also investigate any vassal city. And as of the v2.08 patch the Master can now Airlift units directly into a Vassal's cities.The Master no longer has to pay supply costs for units inside of the Vassal's lands. However, the Master must agree to an Open Borders agreement with the Vassal in order for the Vassal to move units into and out of the Master's territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master can demand any [BOLD]SINGLE[\BOLD] resource from a vassal, even one that the vassal is using. The vassal has the right to refuse the [BOLD]SECOND[\BOLD] demand but if they do the two states are immediately at war. This can come in handy if your Vassal has the only strategic resource available to you: i.e. Copper, Iron, Horses, Oil, Aluminum, etc. Just remember to plan ahead if the resource will lose it's strategic value (cough horses cough).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master's people enjoy increased happiness. Those in the vassal empire suffer decreased happiness (but frankly who cares about that bit, it only acts as an incentive for the Vassal to purchase luxury goods from the Master to placate the populace and so long as you keep your Vassal under heel then it's his problem).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The vassal can't make war or peace on its own. It immediately adopts the master's war and peace relationships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Half of the vassal's territory and population count towards the master's domination victory AND score. Which can truly speed up a Domination or Conquest win.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*You can rehabilitate your relationship over time with the Vassal Civ through normal diplomatic means, i.e. Open borders, Shared State Religions, Mutual Military Struggle (if battling another Civ), occasional gifts, etc. Also, after the v2.08 patch the Mutual Defense Pact bonus is now added into the diplomatic modifier between you and your vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Downside of having a Vassal(s):[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having vassal cities will incur higher maintenance cost for your own cities. And if someone could find me the actual formula so I can provide a clear example of this I (and anyone else who reads this) would greatly appreciate it.Regardless of what the formula is put some extra thought into your economy to counter any uptick in maintenance costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Other civs may like you a little less when you have a vassal. You will most likely see a [BOLD]-1[\BOLD] Diplomacy Penalty in you relations with other Civ's as they "Fear their Rivals becoming your Vassal."This penalty is somewhat relative to the power of the Vassal-ed Civ.But regardless, if you have 3 Vassal's of even modest power expect a [BOLD]-3[\BOLD] penalty with every other Civ left.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Similarly, a Vassal who has gone around the continent stirring up trouble is not going to be a good choice to become a Voluntary Vassal as the other Civ's will view your patronage as if you were allies.The AI hatred of your Vassal may override their friendly feelings towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Although you can direct what your Vassal researches the Vassal's Master doesn't share in the discovery.So if your vassal somehow manages to acquire some technology you don't have, he doesn't have to share it with you, nor can you compel the Vassal into sharing the tech.This is the complete opposite of the same occurrence during a Permanent Alliance, where the two allies can research different techs and the discoveries are shared between the two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Your Economy: The ONLY thing that Matters:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before you consider whether or not take on a Vassal make sure your house is in order first. Other threads have and will explain the specifics how best to manage or to help guide your economic advancement.I will simply sum things up thusly: If you don't have a strong economy you can't afford to do anything with your empire, let alone acquire someone else's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That being said, the increased maintenance costs to your cities can be negated by a strong economy.Which means you need to develop both your cities and your newly acquire cities as quickly and as best as possible.This also means not going pillaging happy during the conquest.You want the war to be as efficient as possible, end as quickly as possible, and the reconstruction to be just as quick.You want those new cities to become profitable to help further expansion of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The maintenance cost is most pronounced if you acquire Vassal's early (like right after discovery of Feudalism) and when the freshly conquered cities aren't quite back online to being profitable for you.Later wars do tend to negate the increase mainly because both you and your Vassal have stronger economies (usually).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Civ's are a bit more suited to this than others due to their leader traits, Creative (+2 Culture in each city), Financial (+1 Commerce on 2 Commerce plots) and Organized (-50% Empire Maintenance) being the more obvious traits.I mention the Creative trait specifically because it will help push the cultural borders out further &amp; quicker thereby getting cities up to their fat cross potential earlier, very handy when subjugating neighbors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside of the creative trait is that it probably won't be the best idea to Vassal-ize a Creative Civ.Although the Vassal cannot take your city from you, he can surround and overwhelm the city culturally, with near constant riots being the result. The Financial &amp; Organized traits should really speak for themselves on this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Thoughts on the Acquisition of Vassals:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The more vastly more preferable situation is to acquire a Vassal through [BOLD]Capitulation[\BOLD].A Voluntary Vassal will simply leave you at the earliest convenient time, usually the most inconvenient time for you after having driven up your maintenance cost and enjoyed your protection.There may good short term advantages to accepting a voluntary Vassal such as beefing up a combined front to stave off more powerful Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A [BOLD]Capitulated Vassal[\BOLD] is going to have one heck of an uphill challenge to get out from under your thumb.For example; let us assume a situation where all things are equal.Both you and your rival have six cities each, each city has 10 population, all cities are growing at roughly the same population rate.You declare war and conquer three of his cities (including the original capital since it is most likely the choicest morsel in his empire).You now have nine cities under your control to his three.Preferably you have taken what I call his core cities, which are the ones that have been founded the earliest and have since been grown and developed, usually the heart of the empire.In the current example your opponent will most likely have three good and three average cities he's working with, which means it's probably going to be beyond his capabilities to ever breach the 50% of Masters Land AND 50% of Maters Population to be able to break away, especially when you keep the war machine rolling, as illustrated below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities**:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]** This example only shows a static situation, if you acquire the Vassals early enough they can expand over time (preferably filling in scrub areas that you yourself don't want to settle, yet you don't want a rival to settle the area as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Population***:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]90***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]120***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]150***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***This wouldn't be exact since cities lose population after conquest but the concept should be clear at this point.Plus if running the slavery civic you can whip away the unhappiness and crank out some buildings which may have been destroyed during the conquest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And what do you think the odds are that any of the Vassals are going to be able to break away? Slim to none.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leveraging Your Vassal's Properly And Making the Most of Them:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch it was possible to simply sell your excess resources to your Vassal(s) even when the Vassal in question had no Gold Per Turn available.The Vassal would come up with the GPT by lowering it's discretionary spending (on such things as Research or Culture).This created a very lucrative (and historically accurate, I might add) incentive for acquiring Vassals and then basically pimping them out into cash cows. . . .ah the good old days.Anyhoo, since the patch this is no longer a real option, a similar effect can be created using the Aggressive Trading / Subsidies Tactic discussed elsewhere.Regardless, Vassals can still be lucrative in the long run (discussed later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To reiterate an earlier point: when acquiring the Vassal [BOLD]DO NOT[\BOLD] pillage the guy to hell and back, the resources will only have to be re-developed and that takes time you wouldn't otherwise have to spend.Pillage the guy to hell and back when you don't think you can take his cities and you want to just punish the guy for your troubles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*When it comes to the [BOLD]Voluntary Vassals[\BOLD], don't gift them any military techs unless you absolutely have to, and at the same time direct their research away from the military techs.Preferably to some mutually beneficial technology which grants the Vassal the ability to harvest some resource (which if necessary you can then demand the resource from the Vassal at a later time).It's very likely that the Voluntary Vassal will forgo your benevolent leadership and managerial skills at some time and break away in the near future.You don't want to create a situation where you've just helped your now rival leap frog up to military parity with you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*What you [BOLD]DO[\BOLD] want to do is get a properly [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] Civ up to speed so it can be the greatest assistance to you, which may include bestowing some military techs to your new Vassal.Thereby allowing him to jump up militarily (though there is a good argument for quantity rather than quality for the Vassal's military, constantly feeding the enemy Great General points and experience points may serve to come back to haunt you).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*After acquiring your new pet you need to get him on your side, you've already shown him the stick now show him the carrot and try to rehabilitate your relationship with the Vassal.Spread your religion to all his remaining cities and cajole him to convert (We Care For Our Brothers &amp; Sisters of Faith), open up the borders, gift him some defunct resource (preferably a defunct resource like Copper when you have Iron, if he doesn't have either he WILL appreciate the Copper, "Our Trade Relations Have Been . . . ").When you go for your next Vassal you'll get a "Mutual Military Struggle" bonus with the current Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It's not important that your Vassal like you, some never will (Monty can really hold a grudge). What [BOLD]IS[\BOLD] important is that he become and remain useful to you.So why try to cozy up to him? Simple, the earlier you acquire the Vassal the more time he has to spread out and stake claims of his own, which can be a double edged sword.It is entirely possible for the Vassal to become pleased with his master, meet the criteria to break away and yet not do so (in this possible, though low probability example, it is important to remember the sage advice: "[BOLD]You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than just a kind word[\BOLD]."So have some weight to back up your dominance).The AI will take into account your, and your remaining Vassals, strength into account when decision times come around.You can never go wrong with having the largest army you can afford.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, as your Vassal's spread out they develop resources which you otherwise would not, I for instance am not sticking some poor settler out BFA (Alaska) just to get some dang fur or deer resource, let the Vassals do that, anyway, more resources your Vassal has the more he can trade with you mutually benefiting both empires.And if your Vassal is of the same faith as ye he will help spread the Word amongst the heathens, spreading the gospel (and your line of sight and your shrine income and potentially laying the seeds for an easier invasion some turns down the road).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The aggressive Civ's tend to make for your better pets, Monty, Alex, etc. especially since once brought to heel tend maintain high military strength even when not ramping up for war, which means they're usually ready to help skullthump on your behalf.Which can soften up or even better create a second front against your next conquest, keeping enemy resources tied up can be an excellent tactic especially if you ask the Vassal to focus on attacking one specific enemy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*In general terms you are probably going to acquire what's closest to you rather than on the far side of the world.Which is usually for the better since it's easier for someone else to pick off something that's closer to them.Which leads to the next two points on Vassal Strategy:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *1*[\BOLD] Vassals can be used as excellent staging platforms for further invasions.For example: pretend there are three Civs: A,B, and C.All three occupy the same continent and border each other in the same alphabetical order.For the moment lets say Civ B is on good terms with both A and C, A and C however don't like each other and soon go to war, with Civ C capitulating and becoming the Vassal of Civ A.Civ B now has a bigger problem than he did before with two neighbors because now he has no hope of any balance of power to maintain his existence.Civ A now has the ability to launch invasions from both sides of Civ B's empire simultaneously, a tactic the AI does not deal with well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *2*[\BOLD] In the same example above Civ B is as likely to attack Civ A's territory as it to attack Civ A's Vassal (the Old Civ C).This leaves the field wide open for Civ A to invade while Civ B concentrates on Civ C and any Civ A cities conquered from Civ C.Here's the great part, if B does manage to make headway on the Vassal and knock out enough territory to break the Vassal agreement, who cares if the Vassal's cities are getting raised or captured? It's better that the losses consume and distract Civ B's military resources while Civ A rolls on in from the opposite side and forces Civ B to capitulate.All in all Civ A is sitting pretty with all of it's territory and a chunk of Civ B and Civ C's territory, plus some vassals to kick around.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To summarize the above, it's better for your Vassal(s) to take a beating than you.In which case if you're Civ A and Civ B becomes your Vassal keep the fighting in either the occupied territories of Civ B or on Civ C's doorstep.Let Vassal Civ B be both your doormat and your buffer zone.Because remember, that's what Civ B is there for, to eat the bullet so you don't have to.This particular point also illustrates my only successful use of the Machine Gunner, I stuck Combat One and Medic One promoted MG in my Vassal's border cities, I still pity those poor Egyptian Cavalrymen who generously donated 32 units to theGreat General fund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Other Fine Points:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A general piece of Warmongering Advice: the first Civ you meet isn't going to be the best candidate for Vassal-ing.Generally speaking the first Civ you run across is probably going to be your best bet for early elimination and/or outright acquisition.If you're skullthumping your neighbor with early swordsman (or earlier with axmen, warriors, etc.) then you aren't going to be Vassal-ing anybody anyway since you probably haven't got Feudalism.Therefore, if you do go to war finish the other guy off completely, no sense of having some enemy out on the field for the better part of eternity with a grudge just waiting to come back to haunt you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*One of the major points about Vassal's is that an attack on the Vassal is an attack on the Master, which can be quite a disincentive to attack either.The flip side to this is that you can be at peace minding your business when chuckles knocks on your door begging to be your Vassal, and maybe you've been a bit inattentive in monitoring the current state of relations and decided to accept the Vassal.At which point his enemies are now [BOLD]YOUR[\BOLD] enemies thus dragging you into some conflagration you weren't prepared for or desired (of course this could just be the pretext you want for war with the other Civ's being the aggressors instead of you, thereby keeping the old War Weariness down by fighting on home turf as opposed to foreign lands).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch there was a tendency by the AI that when losing a war with the player, the AI would align itself with a Player-"friendly" Civ by becoming a Vassal and then drag a Civ, which the player may have been closely "allied" with, into war against the player. [BOLD]The v2.08 patch did not create some magic rule saying this can no longer happen just that the decision would be more thoughtfully evaluated by the AI[\BOLD]. A good quick, rule of thumb is that one of the factors the AI is going to judge this decision by is: is your military power equal to, less than or significantly greater then, his and his new Vassal's military power. If your "Ally" thinks he could otherwise take you on and come out the better he is going to do it ([BOLD]and let's be blunt, so would you[\BOLD]). Your "[BOLD]Ally[\BOLD]" basically weights the decision like this: "[BOLD]Yeah, I'm friendly with the player, but is this too good an opportunity to pass up[\BOLD]?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It may not be necessary or prudent to accept a Civ's offer of Capitulation the first time it's offered.For example, say you invade an island and take two of three cities, the remaining city being the enemy capital.And the other civ knows he's beat will offer to Capitulate.Don't vassal the civ until AFTER you've taken the capital otherwise the culture war will be a constant irritation in later turns ("[BOLD]An Indian revolt is taking place in Madras...[\BOLD]").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having and acquiring Vassals allows you to run a more precise offense allowing you to cut down dramatically on Domination and Conquest wins.Taking the same six city example from above, let us simply score 1 city as one point and 1 population as 1 point.The first war takes your base of six to nine, a 50% increase in lands directly held to you, plus you get half of your Vassal points (1.5), which in this grossly simplified score gets you a total point score of 10.5 as opposed to 9.The second Vassal would take your base score to 12 points with an additional 3 coming from your Vassals, totaling 15.The third Vassal war would take you to a 15 point base with an additional 4.5 from your Vassals bring the total up to: 19.5. In this case your Vassals are increasing your score by about 30%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[TAB]Vassal 2[TAB]Vassal 3[TAB]Total pts.[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6 / 6pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 pts(+0%)[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9 / 9pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]10.5pts (+16%)[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12 / 12pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]15pts (+25%)[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15 / 15pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pt[TAB]19.5pts (+30%)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not to shabby in my opinion.And this of course neglects any expansion done by the Vassals after Vassalization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To follow up on the preceding point about running a precise offense.The strategy is that if one is able and willing to accept Vassals then the volume of necessary fighting that you'll have to do will be reduced, therefore lowering the costs of the war in time and material. Why waste time conquering an empire of 20 cities if you only have to take the six best ones to impose a favorable peace?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Superpowers and Hyperpowers and General Compaints:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Vassal system turned on, the larger the map and the more Civs in the game, there is a much greater tendency for the formations of [BOLD]Super[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Hyper-powers[\BOLD]. Without the Vassal system you could expect to see a web of Mutual Defense Pacts, even occasionally some Permanent Alliances, for a real life example think back to pre-World War One days with the complicated networking of treaties. But, with the Vassal system you can expect the AI's to cluster together with a strong Civ achieving dominance over one, or several, rival Civs which can be aligned against you. A real life example, the Soviet Union and it's client states during the Cold War. With the Vassal system the same advantages which the player can exploit, can also be exploited by the AI, with the results being a patchwork of regional and super powers developing on the map.Which probably bears some relation to Medieval Europe in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the [BOLD]Hyperpower[\BOLD] situation, you have one Civ with a relatively large expansion of it's own, coupled with not just one or several Vassals, but with a great many Vassal client states, each sufficiently developed in their own right.Hopefully, this is the player being the Hyperpower and not the AI.One can be forgiven for thinking that this would have a chilling effect on wars breaking out, or at least if war did break out it would be the Hyperpower looking to expand.However, this isn't always the case.A regional superpower or even separate (yet diplomatically close) Civs may try to break up the emerging or developing Hyperpower by launching a Pre-Emptive attack.Usually you can expect to see this happen once you start seeing the "You've grown too powerful for us" diplomatic response to even the simplest of trades.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the many frequent complaints about the Vassal system is that it can be a deterrent for warmongering, "I can't attack him without declaring war on his master and other Vassals" etc. etc., usually followed by some comment about the system being "broken." [BOLD]It's not broken, you just don't like the result[\BOLD].I can attest to the aggravation of being sidled up next to an emerging hyper power and not being able to have done anything about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What feels eminently worse though, is when you attack another Civ, take a chunk and declare peace with the intent of re-declaring war after a short respite and chucklehead has gone off and Voluntarily become a Vassal of someone you don't really want to tangle with.[BOLD]Again, it's aggravating but the system isn't broke, we just don't like the outcome[\BOLD].If anything it's working perfectly when your victim does this as he maintains a chance at independence and keeps you from gobbling him up. Cheeky monkey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other major complaint I see cropping up from the Vassal system is that it encourages a Warmongering Strategy at the expense of a "Builder's" strategy (i.e., Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories).Ironically this is pretty much the exact opposite of the above complaint but whatever.If anything it is equally likely that a network of known treaties and Vassals would encourage peacefully strategies, especially if no Civ groupings can think they can take on and prevail against it's rival Civ groupings, thus creating a Cold War situation.As always, you must be prepared for war in order to secure peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An aside: it is the scoring system that is nerfed, not the Vassal system.The scoring system heavily factors Time / Turns Elapsed over Type of victory.Since Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories only become possible in the late game the higher scoring games will come about primarily through War Mongering, a great great many game will end before even the option to score a Diplomatic win becomes available (let alone Space Race).A retuning of the scoring system would clear up most of the "balancing issues" in terms of strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Outsanding Questions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE](For which if someone could locate in the xml's or wherever I would be gratefull to know the answers to)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Maintenance?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Happiness boost to Master?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]References:[NEWLINE]The Civilopedia[NEWLINE]v2.08 Patch info by Thunderfall[NEWLINE]Me</German>

Vassal states are like an "asymmetric alliance" between two Civs.Basically, one civilization serves as the master in the relationship and collects tribute from the weaker, vassal nation.After the discovery of Feudalism the Vassal State option becomes available in the Diplomacy menu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two ways to acquire a vassal state, [BOLD]voluntary[\BOLD] Vassal-ing, and [BOLD]Non-voluntary ([BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD])[\BOLD] Vassal-ing.The second acquisition method is more common, basically consisting of skull-thumping another Civ until it cries "uncle" and begs for mercy.At which point the losing Civ Capitulates to the winning Civ sacrificing it's independence for mere survival and a chance (usually small) at one day regaining independence.A Vassal State that has [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] does not get the option to voluntarily end the Vassal agreement unless certain conditions are met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The less common method occurs during peacetime where a relatively small and weak Civ tries to partner up with a much more powerful Civ, and in exchange for protection agrees to become a Vassal State.A Civ which becomes a Vassal State during peace time is given the opportunity every 10 turns to end the agreement.Throughout long and turbulent games some states may routinely enter into and out of being a Vassal State frequently.When a Voluntary Vassal decides to secede the Master Civ is given the option of simply allowing the Vassal State to become independent, or can choose to protest this decision, in which case both states then become locked in a state of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In both cases, a Vassal State may choose to break the Vassal agreement when any of the three following conditions occur:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 1:[\BOLD] The Vassal State looses more than half of it's territory that it owned at the time it became a Vassal State.For example: Monty become your Vassal and has 4 cities when he becomes your Vassal.Over time Monty grows his Civ to 8 cities total.If Monty looses 4 of his cities through war or culture flipping, he still has 4 cities left and cannot break the agreement.If he lost 6 of his 8 cities he will then have lost 50% of his original lands and can then choose to end the agreement (usually with some terse statement about "not being able to protect us.") [BOLD]It should also be noted that if your Vassal looses cities, etc. to [BOLD]YOU[\BOLD] through culture flipping [BOLD]THAT[\BOLD] also counts towards the loss of territory condition[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 2:[\BOLD] The Vassal State grows in size [BOLD]AND[\BOLD] population to a point where it has more than [BOLD]50% of the Master Civ's size AND population[\BOLD].It's important to reiterate that this is a two part condition.[BOLD]BOTH[\BOLD] have to be met in order for this option to become available to the Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 3:[\BOLD]This is a minor possibility which can occur, where the Master demands a particular resource and the Vassal refuses the Masters request, in which case the two states are at war.This does happen, but it hasn't happened to me since I try to eliminate any potential escape route for my new pets.Since the Master can demand any single resource from the Vassal and the Vassal can't refuse this single / first demand it's best to choose the resource carefully, i.e. a strategic resource of some sort.Let's say you're in the classical or medieval era and need your Vassal's horse resource so you demand and take.But later on you somehow lose your source of iron and demand it from your Vassal, he can refuse and break the Vassal agreement. So plan ahead when it comes to your resource requests. And by the way there is nothing to stop you from selling the horse back to your Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Should a Vassal choose to break the agreement due to the above conditions listed above, the Vassals Master may not agree to peaceably allow the Vassal to become independent, in which case a state of war exists between the two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regrettably, [BOLD]there is currently no method to Release a Vassal from your control[\BOLD], so weigh your decision carefully before accepting a Vassal.[This statement is true as of and up to the v2.08 patch, you'd think this would be an obvious feature to include in the game considering it would make things more logically consistent AND reflect actual history, but whatever].Theoretically it is possible to actually aggravate your vassal into refusing a resource demand at which point the Master could then decide to let the Vassal go or go to war with the now ex-Vassal IF the Vassal refuses the resource demand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some basic pro's of acquiring a Vassal:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master enjoys complete freedom of movement in the vassal's territory, including the ability to heal normally in the vassal's territory and use fortifications owned by the vassal. The master can also investigate any vassal city. And as of the v2.08 patch the Master can now Airlift units directly into a Vassal's cities.The Master no longer has to pay supply costs for units inside of the Vassal's lands. However, the Master must agree to an Open Borders agreement with the Vassal in order for the Vassal to move units into and out of the Master's territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master can demand any [BOLD]SINGLE[\BOLD] resource from a vassal, even one that the vassal is using. The vassal has the right to refuse the [BOLD]SECOND[\BOLD] demand but if they do the two states are immediately at war. This can come in handy if your Vassal has the only strategic resource available to you: i.e. Copper, Iron, Horses, Oil, Aluminum, etc. Just remember to plan ahead if the resource will lose it's strategic value (cough horses cough).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master's people enjoy increased happiness. Those in the vassal empire suffer decreased happiness (but frankly who cares about that bit, it only acts as an incentive for the Vassal to purchase luxury goods from the Master to placate the populace and so long as you keep your Vassal under heel then it's his problem).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The vassal can't make war or peace on its own. It immediately adopts the master's war and peace relationships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Half of the vassal's territory and population count towards the master's domination victory AND score. Which can truly speed up a Domination or Conquest win.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*You can rehabilitate your relationship over time with the Vassal Civ through normal diplomatic means, i.e. Open borders, Shared State Religions, Mutual Military Struggle (if battling another Civ), occasional gifts, etc. Also, after the v2.08 patch the Mutual Defense Pact bonus is now added into the diplomatic modifier between you and your vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Downside of having a Vassal(s):[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having vassal cities will incur higher maintenance cost for your own cities. And if someone could find me the actual formula so I can provide a clear example of this I (and anyone else who reads this) would greatly appreciate it.Regardless of what the formula is put some extra thought into your economy to counter any uptick in maintenance costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Other civs may like you a little less when you have a vassal. You will most likely see a [BOLD]-1[\BOLD] Diplomacy Penalty in you relations with other Civ's as they "Fear their Rivals becoming your Vassal."This penalty is somewhat relative to the power of the Vassal-ed Civ.But regardless, if you have 3 Vassal's of even modest power expect a [BOLD]-3[\BOLD] penalty with every other Civ left.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Similarly, a Vassal who has gone around the continent stirring up trouble is not going to be a good choice to become a Voluntary Vassal as the other Civ's will view your patronage as if you were allies.The AI hatred of your Vassal may override their friendly feelings towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Although you can direct what your Vassal researches the Vassal's Master doesn't share in the discovery.So if your vassal somehow manages to acquire some technology you don't have, he doesn't have to share it with you, nor can you compel the Vassal into sharing the tech.This is the complete opposite of the same occurrence during a Permanent Alliance, where the two allies can research different techs and the discoveries are shared between the two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Your Economy: The ONLY thing that Matters:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before you consider whether or not take on a Vassal make sure your house is in order first. Other threads have and will explain the specifics how best to manage or to help guide your economic advancement.I will simply sum things up thusly: If you don't have a strong economy you can't afford to do anything with your empire, let alone acquire someone else's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That being said, the increased maintenance costs to your cities can be negated by a strong economy.Which means you need to develop both your cities and your newly acquire cities as quickly and as best as possible.This also means not going pillaging happy during the conquest.You want the war to be as efficient as possible, end as quickly as possible, and the reconstruction to be just as quick.You want those new cities to become profitable to help further expansion of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The maintenance cost is most pronounced if you acquire Vassal's early (like right after discovery of Feudalism) and when the freshly conquered cities aren't quite back online to being profitable for you.Later wars do tend to negate the increase mainly because both you and your Vassal have stronger economies (usually).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Civ's are a bit more suited to this than others due to their leader traits, Creative (+2 Culture in each city), Financial (+1 Commerce on 2 Commerce plots) and Organized (-50% Empire Maintenance) being the more obvious traits.I mention the Creative trait specifically because it will help push the cultural borders out further &amp; quicker thereby getting cities up to their fat cross potential earlier, very handy when subjugating neighbors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside of the creative trait is that it probably won't be the best idea to Vassal-ize a Creative Civ.Although the Vassal cannot take your city from you, he can surround and overwhelm the city culturally, with near constant riots being the result. The Financial &amp; Organized traits should really speak for themselves on this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Thoughts on the Acquisition of Vassals:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The more vastly more preferable situation is to acquire a Vassal through [BOLD]Capitulation[\BOLD].A Voluntary Vassal will simply leave you at the earliest convenient time, usually the most inconvenient time for you after having driven up your maintenance cost and enjoyed your protection.There may good short term advantages to accepting a voluntary Vassal such as beefing up a combined front to stave off more powerful Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A [BOLD]Capitulated Vassal[\BOLD] is going to have one heck of an uphill challenge to get out from under your thumb.For example; let us assume a situation where all things are equal.Both you and your rival have six cities each, each city has 10 population, all cities are growing at roughly the same population rate.You declare war and conquer three of his cities (including the original capital since it is most likely the choicest morsel in his empire).You now have nine cities under your control to his three.Preferably you have taken what I call his core cities, which are the ones that have been founded the earliest and have since been grown and developed, usually the heart of the empire.In the current example your opponent will most likely have three good and three average cities he's working with, which means it's probably going to be beyond his capabilities to ever breach the 50% of Masters Land AND 50% of Maters Population to be able to break away, especially when you keep the war machine rolling, as illustrated below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities**:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]** This example only shows a static situation, if you acquire the Vassals early enough they can expand over time (preferably filling in scrub areas that you yourself don't want to settle, yet you don't want a rival to settle the area as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Population***:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]90***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]120***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]150***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***This wouldn't be exact since cities lose population after conquest but the concept should be clear at this point.Plus if running the slavery civic you can whip away the unhappiness and crank out some buildings which may have been destroyed during the conquest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And what do you think the odds are that any of the Vassals are going to be able to break away? Slim to none.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leveraging Your Vassal's Properly And Making the Most of Them:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch it was possible to simply sell your excess resources to your Vassal(s) even when the Vassal in question had no Gold Per Turn available.The Vassal would come up with the GPT by lowering it's discretionary spending (on such things as Research or Culture).This created a very lucrative (and historically accurate, I might add) incentive for acquiring Vassals and then basically pimping them out into cash cows. . . .ah the good old days.Anyhoo, since the patch this is no longer a real option, a similar effect can be created using the Aggressive Trading / Subsidies Tactic discussed elsewhere.Regardless, Vassals can still be lucrative in the long run (discussed later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To reiterate an earlier point: when acquiring the Vassal [BOLD]DO NOT[\BOLD] pillage the guy to hell and back, the resources will only have to be re-developed and that takes time you wouldn't otherwise have to spend.Pillage the guy to hell and back when you don't think you can take his cities and you want to just punish the guy for your troubles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*When it comes to the [BOLD]Voluntary Vassals[\BOLD], don't gift them any military techs unless you absolutely have to, and at the same time direct their research away from the military techs.Preferably to some mutually beneficial technology which grants the Vassal the ability to harvest some resource (which if necessary you can then demand the resource from the Vassal at a later time).It's very likely that the Voluntary Vassal will forgo your benevolent leadership and managerial skills at some time and break away in the near future.You don't want to create a situation where you've just helped your now rival leap frog up to military parity with you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*What you [BOLD]DO[\BOLD] want to do is get a properly [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] Civ up to speed so it can be the greatest assistance to you, which may include bestowing some military techs to your new Vassal.Thereby allowing him to jump up militarily (though there is a good argument for quantity rather than quality for the Vassal's military, constantly feeding the enemy Great General points and experience points may serve to come back to haunt you).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*After acquiring your new pet you need to get him on your side, you've already shown him the stick now show him the carrot and try to rehabilitate your relationship with the Vassal.Spread your religion to all his remaining cities and cajole him to convert (We Care For Our Brothers &amp; Sisters of Faith), open up the borders, gift him some defunct resource (preferably a defunct resource like Copper when you have Iron, if he doesn't have either he WILL appreciate the Copper, "Our Trade Relations Have Been . . . ").When you go for your next Vassal you'll get a "Mutual Military Struggle" bonus with the current Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It's not important that your Vassal like you, some never will (Monty can really hold a grudge). What [BOLD]IS[\BOLD] important is that he become and remain useful to you.So why try to cozy up to him? Simple, the earlier you acquire the Vassal the more time he has to spread out and stake claims of his own, which can be a double edged sword.It is entirely possible for the Vassal to become pleased with his master, meet the criteria to break away and yet not do so (in this possible, though low probability example, it is important to remember the sage advice: "[BOLD]You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than just a kind word[\BOLD]."So have some weight to back up your dominance).The AI will take into account your, and your remaining Vassals, strength into account when decision times come around.You can never go wrong with having the largest army you can afford.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, as your Vassal's spread out they develop resources which you otherwise would not, I for instance am not sticking some poor settler out BFA (Alaska) just to get some dang fur or deer resource, let the Vassals do that, anyway, more resources your Vassal has the more he can trade with you mutually benefiting both empires.And if your Vassal is of the same faith as ye he will help spread the Word amongst the heathens, spreading the gospel (and your line of sight and your shrine income and potentially laying the seeds for an easier invasion some turns down the road).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The aggressive Civ's tend to make for your better pets, Monty, Alex, etc. especially since once brought to heel tend maintain high military strength even when not ramping up for war, which means they're usually ready to help skullthump on your behalf.Which can soften up or even better create a second front against your next conquest, keeping enemy resources tied up can be an excellent tactic especially if you ask the Vassal to focus on attacking one specific enemy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*In general terms you are probably going to acquire what's closest to you rather than on the far side of the world.Which is usually for the better since it's easier for someone else to pick off something that's closer to them.Which leads to the next two points on Vassal Strategy:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *1*[\BOLD] Vassals can be used as excellent staging platforms for further invasions.For example: pretend there are three Civs: A,B, and C.All three occupy the same continent and border each other in the same alphabetical order.For the moment lets say Civ B is on good terms with both A and C, A and C however don't like each other and soon go to war, with Civ C capitulating and becoming the Vassal of Civ A.Civ B now has a bigger problem than he did before with two neighbors because now he has no hope of any balance of power to maintain his existence.Civ A now has the ability to launch invasions from both sides of Civ B's empire simultaneously, a tactic the AI does not deal with well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *2*[\BOLD] In the same example above Civ B is as likely to attack Civ A's territory as it to attack Civ A's Vassal (the Old Civ C).This leaves the field wide open for Civ A to invade while Civ B concentrates on Civ C and any Civ A cities conquered from Civ C.Here's the great part, if B does manage to make headway on the Vassal and knock out enough territory to break the Vassal agreement, who cares if the Vassal's cities are getting raised or captured? It's better that the losses consume and distract Civ B's military resources while Civ A rolls on in from the opposite side and forces Civ B to capitulate.All in all Civ A is sitting pretty with all of it's territory and a chunk of Civ B and Civ C's territory, plus some vassals to kick around.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To summarize the above, it's better for your Vassal(s) to take a beating than you.In which case if you're Civ A and Civ B becomes your Vassal keep the fighting in either the occupied territories of Civ B or on Civ C's doorstep.Let Vassal Civ B be both your doormat and your buffer zone.Because remember, that's what Civ B is there for, to eat the bullet so you don't have to.This particular point also illustrates my only successful use of the Machine Gunner, I stuck Combat One and Medic One promoted MG in my Vassal's border cities, I still pity those poor Egyptian Cavalrymen who generously donated 32 units to theGreat General fund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Other Fine Points:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A general piece of Warmongering Advice: the first Civ you meet isn't going to be the best candidate for Vassal-ing.Generally speaking the first Civ you run across is probably going to be your best bet for early elimination and/or outright acquisition.If you're skullthumping your neighbor with early swordsman (or earlier with axmen, warriors, etc.) then you aren't going to be Vassal-ing anybody anyway since you probably haven't got Feudalism.Therefore, if you do go to war finish the other guy off completely, no sense of having some enemy out on the field for the better part of eternity with a grudge just waiting to come back to haunt you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*One of the major points about Vassal's is that an attack on the Vassal is an attack on the Master, which can be quite a disincentive to attack either.The flip side to this is that you can be at peace minding your business when chuckles knocks on your door begging to be your Vassal, and maybe you've been a bit inattentive in monitoring the current state of relations and decided to accept the Vassal.At which point his enemies are now [BOLD]YOUR[\BOLD] enemies thus dragging you into some conflagration you weren't prepared for or desired (of course this could just be the pretext you want for war with the other Civ's being the aggressors instead of you, thereby keeping the old War Weariness down by fighting on home turf as opposed to foreign lands).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch there was a tendency by the AI that when losing a war with the player, the AI would align itself with a Player-"friendly" Civ by becoming a Vassal and then drag a Civ, which the player may have been closely "allied" with, into war against the player. [BOLD]The v2.08 patch did not create some magic rule saying this can no longer happen just that the decision would be more thoughtfully evaluated by the AI[\BOLD]. A good quick, rule of thumb is that one of the factors the AI is going to judge this decision by is: is your military power equal to, less than or significantly greater then, his and his new Vassal's military power. If your "Ally" thinks he could otherwise take you on and come out the better he is going to do it ([BOLD]and let's be blunt, so would you[\BOLD]). Your "[BOLD]Ally[\BOLD]" basically weights the decision like this: "[BOLD]Yeah, I'm friendly with the player, but is this too good an opportunity to pass up[\BOLD]?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It may not be necessary or prudent to accept a Civ's offer of Capitulation the first time it's offered.For example, say you invade an island and take two of three cities, the remaining city being the enemy capital.And the other civ knows he's beat will offer to Capitulate.Don't vassal the civ until AFTER you've taken the capital otherwise the culture war will be a constant irritation in later turns ("[BOLD]An Indian revolt is taking place in Madras...[\BOLD]").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having and acquiring Vassals allows you to run a more precise offense allowing you to cut down dramatically on Domination and Conquest wins.Taking the same six city example from above, let us simply score 1 city as one point and 1 population as 1 point.The first war takes your base of six to nine, a 50% increase in lands directly held to you, plus you get half of your Vassal points (1.5), which in this grossly simplified score gets you a total point score of 10.5 as opposed to 9.The second Vassal would take your base score to 12 points with an additional 3 coming from your Vassals, totaling 15.The third Vassal war would take you to a 15 point base with an additional 4.5 from your Vassals bring the total up to: 19.5. In this case your Vassals are increasing your score by about 30%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[TAB]Vassal 2[TAB]Vassal 3[TAB]Total pts.[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6 / 6pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 pts(+0%)[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9 / 9pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]10.5pts (+16%)[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12 / 12pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]15pts (+25%)[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15 / 15pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pt[TAB]19.5pts (+30%)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not to shabby in my opinion.And this of course neglects any expansion done by the Vassals after Vassalization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To follow up on the preceding point about running a precise offense.The strategy is that if one is able and willing to accept Vassals then the volume of necessary fighting that you'll have to do will be reduced, therefore lowering the costs of the war in time and material. Why waste time conquering an empire of 20 cities if you only have to take the six best ones to impose a favorable peace?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Superpowers and Hyperpowers and General Compaints:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Vassal system turned on, the larger the map and the more Civs in the game, there is a much greater tendency for the formations of [BOLD]Super[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Hyper-powers[\BOLD]. Without the Vassal system you could expect to see a web of Mutual Defense Pacts, even occasionally some Permanent Alliances, for a real life example think back to pre-World War One days with the complicated networking of treaties. But, with the Vassal system you can expect the AI's to cluster together with a strong Civ achieving dominance over one, or several, rival Civs which can be aligned against you. A real life example, the Soviet Union and it's client states during the Cold War. With the Vassal system the same advantages which the player can exploit, can also be exploited by the AI, with the results being a patchwork of regional and super powers developing on the map.Which probably bears some relation to Medieval Europe in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the [BOLD]Hyperpower[\BOLD] situation, you have one Civ with a relatively large expansion of it's own, coupled with not just one or several Vassals, but with a great many Vassal client states, each sufficiently developed in their own right.Hopefully, this is the player being the Hyperpower and not the AI.One can be forgiven for thinking that this would have a chilling effect on wars breaking out, or at least if war did break out it would be the Hyperpower looking to expand.However, this isn't always the case.A regional superpower or even separate (yet diplomatically close) Civs may try to break up the emerging or developing Hyperpower by launching a Pre-Emptive attack.Usually you can expect to see this happen once you start seeing the "You've grown too powerful for us" diplomatic response to even the simplest of trades.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the many frequent complaints about the Vassal system is that it can be a deterrent for warmongering, "I can't attack him without declaring war on his master and other Vassals" etc. etc., usually followed by some comment about the system being "broken." [BOLD]It's not broken, you just don't like the result[\BOLD].I can attest to the aggravation of being sidled up next to an emerging hyper power and not being able to have done anything about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What feels eminently worse though, is when you attack another Civ, take a chunk and declare peace with the intent of re-declaring war after a short respite and chucklehead has gone off and Voluntarily become a Vassal of someone you don't really want to tangle with.[BOLD]Again, it's aggravating but the system isn't broke, we just don't like the outcome[\BOLD].If anything it's working perfectly when your victim does this as he maintains a chance at independence and keeps you from gobbling him up. Cheeky monkey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other major complaint I see cropping up from the Vassal system is that it encourages a Warmongering Strategy at the expense of a "Builder's" strategy (i.e., Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories).Ironically this is pretty much the exact opposite of the above complaint but whatever.If anything it is equally likely that a network of known treaties and Vassals would encourage peacefully strategies, especially if no Civ groupings can think they can take on and prevail against it's rival Civ groupings, thus creating a Cold War situation.As always, you must be prepared for war in order to secure peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An aside: it is the scoring system that is nerfed, not the Vassal system.The scoring system heavily factors Time / Turns Elapsed over Type of victory.Since Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories only become possible in the late game the higher scoring games will come about primarily through War Mongering, a great great many game will end before even the option to score a Diplomatic win becomes available (let alone Space Race).A retuning of the scoring system would clear up most of the "balancing issues" in terms of strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Outsanding Questions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE](For which if someone could locate in the xml's or wherever I would be gratefull to know the answers to)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Maintenance?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Happiness boost to Master?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]References:[NEWLINE]The Civilopedia[NEWLINE]v2.08 Patch info by Thunderfall[NEWLINE]Me</Italian>

Vassal states are like an "asymmetric alliance" between two Civs.Basically, one civilization serves as the master in the relationship and collects tribute from the weaker, vassal nation.After the discovery of Feudalism the Vassal State option becomes available in the Diplomacy menu.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two ways to acquire a vassal state, [BOLD]voluntary[\BOLD] Vassal-ing, and [BOLD]Non-voluntary ([BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD])[\BOLD] Vassal-ing.The second acquisition method is more common, basically consisting of skull-thumping another Civ until it cries "uncle" and begs for mercy.At which point the losing Civ Capitulates to the winning Civ sacrificing it's independence for mere survival and a chance (usually small) at one day regaining independence.A Vassal State that has [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] does not get the option to voluntarily end the Vassal agreement unless certain conditions are met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The less common method occurs during peacetime where a relatively small and weak Civ tries to partner up with a much more powerful Civ, and in exchange for protection agrees to become a Vassal State.A Civ which becomes a Vassal State during peace time is given the opportunity every 10 turns to end the agreement.Throughout long and turbulent games some states may routinely enter into and out of being a Vassal State frequently.When a Voluntary Vassal decides to secede the Master Civ is given the option of simply allowing the Vassal State to become independent, or can choose to protest this decision, in which case both states then become locked in a state of war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In both cases, a Vassal State may choose to break the Vassal agreement when any of the three following conditions occur:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 1:[\BOLD] The Vassal State looses more than half of it's territory that it owned at the time it became a Vassal State.For example: Monty become your Vassal and has 4 cities when he becomes your Vassal.Over time Monty grows his Civ to 8 cities total.If Monty looses 4 of his cities through war or culture flipping, he still has 4 cities left and cannot break the agreement.If he lost 6 of his 8 cities he will then have lost 50% of his original lands and can then choose to end the agreement (usually with some terse statement about "not being able to protect us.") [BOLD]It should also be noted that if your Vassal looses cities, etc. to [BOLD]YOU[\BOLD] through culture flipping [BOLD]THAT[\BOLD] also counts towards the loss of territory condition[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 2:[\BOLD] The Vassal State grows in size [BOLD]AND[\BOLD] population to a point where it has more than [BOLD]50% of the Master Civ's size AND population[\BOLD].It's important to reiterate that this is a two part condition.[BOLD]BOTH[\BOLD] have to be met in order for this option to become available to the Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][BOLD]Condition 3:[\BOLD]This is a minor possibility which can occur, where the Master demands a particular resource and the Vassal refuses the Masters request, in which case the two states are at war.This does happen, but it hasn't happened to me since I try to eliminate any potential escape route for my new pets.Since the Master can demand any single resource from the Vassal and the Vassal can't refuse this single / first demand it's best to choose the resource carefully, i.e. a strategic resource of some sort.Let's say you're in the classical or medieval era and need your Vassal's horse resource so you demand and take.But later on you somehow lose your source of iron and demand it from your Vassal, he can refuse and break the Vassal agreement. So plan ahead when it comes to your resource requests. And by the way there is nothing to stop you from selling the horse back to your Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Should a Vassal choose to break the agreement due to the above conditions listed above, the Vassals Master may not agree to peaceably allow the Vassal to become independent, in which case a state of war exists between the two Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Regrettably, [BOLD]there is currently no method to Release a Vassal from your control[\BOLD], so weigh your decision carefully before accepting a Vassal.[This statement is true as of and up to the v2.08 patch, you'd think this would be an obvious feature to include in the game considering it would make things more logically consistent AND reflect actual history, but whatever].Theoretically it is possible to actually aggravate your vassal into refusing a resource demand at which point the Master could then decide to let the Vassal go or go to war with the now ex-Vassal IF the Vassal refuses the resource demand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some basic pro's of acquiring a Vassal:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master enjoys complete freedom of movement in the vassal's territory, including the ability to heal normally in the vassal's territory and use fortifications owned by the vassal. The master can also investigate any vassal city. And as of the v2.08 patch the Master can now Airlift units directly into a Vassal's cities.The Master no longer has to pay supply costs for units inside of the Vassal's lands. However, the Master must agree to an Open Borders agreement with the Vassal in order for the Vassal to move units into and out of the Master's territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master can demand any [BOLD]SINGLE[\BOLD] resource from a vassal, even one that the vassal is using. The vassal has the right to refuse the [BOLD]SECOND[\BOLD] demand but if they do the two states are immediately at war. This can come in handy if your Vassal has the only strategic resource available to you: i.e. Copper, Iron, Horses, Oil, Aluminum, etc. Just remember to plan ahead if the resource will lose it's strategic value (cough horses cough).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The master's people enjoy increased happiness. Those in the vassal empire suffer decreased happiness (but frankly who cares about that bit, it only acts as an incentive for the Vassal to purchase luxury goods from the Master to placate the populace and so long as you keep your Vassal under heel then it's his problem).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The vassal can't make war or peace on its own. It immediately adopts the master's war and peace relationships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Half of the vassal's territory and population count towards the master's domination victory AND score. Which can truly speed up a Domination or Conquest win.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*You can rehabilitate your relationship over time with the Vassal Civ through normal diplomatic means, i.e. Open borders, Shared State Religions, Mutual Military Struggle (if battling another Civ), occasional gifts, etc. Also, after the v2.08 patch the Mutual Defense Pact bonus is now added into the diplomatic modifier between you and your vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Downside of having a Vassal(s):[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having vassal cities will incur higher maintenance cost for your own cities. And if someone could find me the actual formula so I can provide a clear example of this I (and anyone else who reads this) would greatly appreciate it.Regardless of what the formula is put some extra thought into your economy to counter any uptick in maintenance costs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Other civs may like you a little less when you have a vassal. You will most likely see a [BOLD]-1[\BOLD] Diplomacy Penalty in you relations with other Civ's as they "Fear their Rivals becoming your Vassal."This penalty is somewhat relative to the power of the Vassal-ed Civ.But regardless, if you have 3 Vassal's of even modest power expect a [BOLD]-3[\BOLD] penalty with every other Civ left.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Similarly, a Vassal who has gone around the continent stirring up trouble is not going to be a good choice to become a Voluntary Vassal as the other Civ's will view your patronage as if you were allies.The AI hatred of your Vassal may override their friendly feelings towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Although you can direct what your Vassal researches the Vassal's Master doesn't share in the discovery.So if your vassal somehow manages to acquire some technology you don't have, he doesn't have to share it with you, nor can you compel the Vassal into sharing the tech.This is the complete opposite of the same occurrence during a Permanent Alliance, where the two allies can research different techs and the discoveries are shared between the two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Your Economy: The ONLY thing that Matters:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before you consider whether or not take on a Vassal make sure your house is in order first. Other threads have and will explain the specifics how best to manage or to help guide your economic advancement.I will simply sum things up thusly: If you don't have a strong economy you can't afford to do anything with your empire, let alone acquire someone else's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That being said, the increased maintenance costs to your cities can be negated by a strong economy.Which means you need to develop both your cities and your newly acquire cities as quickly and as best as possible.This also means not going pillaging happy during the conquest.You want the war to be as efficient as possible, end as quickly as possible, and the reconstruction to be just as quick.You want those new cities to become profitable to help further expansion of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The maintenance cost is most pronounced if you acquire Vassal's early (like right after discovery of Feudalism) and when the freshly conquered cities aren't quite back online to being profitable for you.Later wars do tend to negate the increase mainly because both you and your Vassal have stronger economies (usually).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Civ's are a bit more suited to this than others due to their leader traits, Creative (+2 Culture in each city), Financial (+1 Commerce on 2 Commerce plots) and Organized (-50% Empire Maintenance) being the more obvious traits.I mention the Creative trait specifically because it will help push the cultural borders out further &amp; quicker thereby getting cities up to their fat cross potential earlier, very handy when subjugating neighbors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside of the creative trait is that it probably won't be the best idea to Vassal-ize a Creative Civ.Although the Vassal cannot take your city from you, he can surround and overwhelm the city culturally, with near constant riots being the result. The Financial &amp; Organized traits should really speak for themselves on this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Thoughts on the Acquisition of Vassals:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The more vastly more preferable situation is to acquire a Vassal through [BOLD]Capitulation[\BOLD].A Voluntary Vassal will simply leave you at the earliest convenient time, usually the most inconvenient time for you after having driven up your maintenance cost and enjoyed your protection.There may good short term advantages to accepting a voluntary Vassal such as beefing up a combined front to stave off more powerful Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A [BOLD]Capitulated Vassal[\BOLD] is going to have one heck of an uphill challenge to get out from under your thumb.For example; let us assume a situation where all things are equal.Both you and your rival have six cities each, each city has 10 population, all cities are growing at roughly the same population rate.You declare war and conquer three of his cities (including the original capital since it is most likely the choicest morsel in his empire).You now have nine cities under your control to his three.Preferably you have taken what I call his core cities, which are the ones that have been founded the earliest and have since been grown and developed, usually the heart of the empire.In the current example your opponent will most likely have three good and three average cities he's working with, which means it's probably going to be beyond his capabilities to ever breach the 50% of Masters Land AND 50% of Maters Population to be able to break away, especially when you keep the war machine rolling, as illustrated below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities**:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]6[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[TAB][TAB]3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]** This example only shows a static situation, if you acquire the Vassals early enough they can expand over time (preferably filling in scrub areas that you yourself don't want to settle, yet you don't want a rival to settle the area as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Population***:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 2[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]90***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[TAB][TAB]Vassal 3[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]120***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]60[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]150***[TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[TAB][TAB]30[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***This wouldn't be exact since cities lose population after conquest but the concept should be clear at this point.Plus if running the slavery civic you can whip away the unhappiness and crank out some buildings which may have been destroyed during the conquest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And what do you think the odds are that any of the Vassals are going to be able to break away? Slim to none.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leveraging Your Vassal's Properly And Making the Most of Them:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch it was possible to simply sell your excess resources to your Vassal(s) even when the Vassal in question had no Gold Per Turn available.The Vassal would come up with the GPT by lowering it's discretionary spending (on such things as Research or Culture).This created a very lucrative (and historically accurate, I might add) incentive for acquiring Vassals and then basically pimping them out into cash cows. . . .ah the good old days.Anyhoo, since the patch this is no longer a real option, a similar effect can be created using the Aggressive Trading / Subsidies Tactic discussed elsewhere.Regardless, Vassals can still be lucrative in the long run (discussed later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To reiterate an earlier point: when acquiring the Vassal [BOLD]DO NOT[\BOLD] pillage the guy to hell and back, the resources will only have to be re-developed and that takes time you wouldn't otherwise have to spend.Pillage the guy to hell and back when you don't think you can take his cities and you want to just punish the guy for your troubles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*When it comes to the [BOLD]Voluntary Vassals[\BOLD], don't gift them any military techs unless you absolutely have to, and at the same time direct their research away from the military techs.Preferably to some mutually beneficial technology which grants the Vassal the ability to harvest some resource (which if necessary you can then demand the resource from the Vassal at a later time).It's very likely that the Voluntary Vassal will forgo your benevolent leadership and managerial skills at some time and break away in the near future.You don't want to create a situation where you've just helped your now rival leap frog up to military parity with you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*What you [BOLD]DO[\BOLD] want to do is get a properly [BOLD]Capitulated[\BOLD] Civ up to speed so it can be the greatest assistance to you, which may include bestowing some military techs to your new Vassal.Thereby allowing him to jump up militarily (though there is a good argument for quantity rather than quality for the Vassal's military, constantly feeding the enemy Great General points and experience points may serve to come back to haunt you).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*After acquiring your new pet you need to get him on your side, you've already shown him the stick now show him the carrot and try to rehabilitate your relationship with the Vassal.Spread your religion to all his remaining cities and cajole him to convert (We Care For Our Brothers &amp; Sisters of Faith), open up the borders, gift him some defunct resource (preferably a defunct resource like Copper when you have Iron, if he doesn't have either he WILL appreciate the Copper, "Our Trade Relations Have Been . . . ").When you go for your next Vassal you'll get a "Mutual Military Struggle" bonus with the current Vassal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It's not important that your Vassal like you, some never will (Monty can really hold a grudge). What [BOLD]IS[\BOLD] important is that he become and remain useful to you.So why try to cozy up to him? Simple, the earlier you acquire the Vassal the more time he has to spread out and stake claims of his own, which can be a double edged sword.It is entirely possible for the Vassal to become pleased with his master, meet the criteria to break away and yet not do so (in this possible, though low probability example, it is important to remember the sage advice: "[BOLD]You can get farther with a kind word and a gun than just a kind word[\BOLD]."So have some weight to back up your dominance).The AI will take into account your, and your remaining Vassals, strength into account when decision times come around.You can never go wrong with having the largest army you can afford.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anyway, as your Vassal's spread out they develop resources which you otherwise would not, I for instance am not sticking some poor settler out BFA (Alaska) just to get some dang fur or deer resource, let the Vassals do that, anyway, more resources your Vassal has the more he can trade with you mutually benefiting both empires.And if your Vassal is of the same faith as ye he will help spread the Word amongst the heathens, spreading the gospel (and your line of sight and your shrine income and potentially laying the seeds for an easier invasion some turns down the road).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*The aggressive Civ's tend to make for your better pets, Monty, Alex, etc. especially since once brought to heel tend maintain high military strength even when not ramping up for war, which means they're usually ready to help skullthump on your behalf.Which can soften up or even better create a second front against your next conquest, keeping enemy resources tied up can be an excellent tactic especially if you ask the Vassal to focus on attacking one specific enemy city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*In general terms you are probably going to acquire what's closest to you rather than on the far side of the world.Which is usually for the better since it's easier for someone else to pick off something that's closer to them.Which leads to the next two points on Vassal Strategy:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *1*[\BOLD] Vassals can be used as excellent staging platforms for further invasions.For example: pretend there are three Civs: A,B, and C.All three occupy the same continent and border each other in the same alphabetical order.For the moment lets say Civ B is on good terms with both A and C, A and C however don't like each other and soon go to war, with Civ C capitulating and becoming the Vassal of Civ A.Civ B now has a bigger problem than he did before with two neighbors because now he has no hope of any balance of power to maintain his existence.Civ A now has the ability to launch invasions from both sides of Civ B's empire simultaneously, a tactic the AI does not deal with well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]=> *2*[\BOLD] In the same example above Civ B is as likely to attack Civ A's territory as it to attack Civ A's Vassal (the Old Civ C).This leaves the field wide open for Civ A to invade while Civ B concentrates on Civ C and any Civ A cities conquered from Civ C.Here's the great part, if B does manage to make headway on the Vassal and knock out enough territory to break the Vassal agreement, who cares if the Vassal's cities are getting raised or captured? It's better that the losses consume and distract Civ B's military resources while Civ A rolls on in from the opposite side and forces Civ B to capitulate.All in all Civ A is sitting pretty with all of it's territory and a chunk of Civ B and Civ C's territory, plus some vassals to kick around.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To summarize the above, it's better for your Vassal(s) to take a beating than you.In which case if you're Civ A and Civ B becomes your Vassal keep the fighting in either the occupied territories of Civ B or on Civ C's doorstep.Let Vassal Civ B be both your doormat and your buffer zone.Because remember, that's what Civ B is there for, to eat the bullet so you don't have to.This particular point also illustrates my only successful use of the Machine Gunner, I stuck Combat One and Medic One promoted MG in my Vassal's border cities, I still pity those poor Egyptian Cavalrymen who generously donated 32 units to theGreat General fund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Other Fine Points:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*A general piece of Warmongering Advice: the first Civ you meet isn't going to be the best candidate for Vassal-ing.Generally speaking the first Civ you run across is probably going to be your best bet for early elimination and/or outright acquisition.If you're skullthumping your neighbor with early swordsman (or earlier with axmen, warriors, etc.) then you aren't going to be Vassal-ing anybody anyway since you probably haven't got Feudalism.Therefore, if you do go to war finish the other guy off completely, no sense of having some enemy out on the field for the better part of eternity with a grudge just waiting to come back to haunt you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*One of the major points about Vassal's is that an attack on the Vassal is an attack on the Master, which can be quite a disincentive to attack either.The flip side to this is that you can be at peace minding your business when chuckles knocks on your door begging to be your Vassal, and maybe you've been a bit inattentive in monitoring the current state of relations and decided to accept the Vassal.At which point his enemies are now [BOLD]YOUR[\BOLD] enemies thus dragging you into some conflagration you weren't prepared for or desired (of course this could just be the pretext you want for war with the other Civ's being the aggressors instead of you, thereby keeping the old War Weariness down by fighting on home turf as opposed to foreign lands).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Prior to the v2.08 patch there was a tendency by the AI that when losing a war with the player, the AI would align itself with a Player-"friendly" Civ by becoming a Vassal and then drag a Civ, which the player may have been closely "allied" with, into war against the player. [BOLD]The v2.08 patch did not create some magic rule saying this can no longer happen just that the decision would be more thoughtfully evaluated by the AI[\BOLD]. A good quick, rule of thumb is that one of the factors the AI is going to judge this decision by is: is your military power equal to, less than or significantly greater then, his and his new Vassal's military power. If your "Ally" thinks he could otherwise take you on and come out the better he is going to do it ([BOLD]and let's be blunt, so would you[\BOLD]). Your "[BOLD]Ally[\BOLD]" basically weights the decision like this: "[BOLD]Yeah, I'm friendly with the player, but is this too good an opportunity to pass up[\BOLD]?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*It may not be necessary or prudent to accept a Civ's offer of Capitulation the first time it's offered.For example, say you invade an island and take two of three cities, the remaining city being the enemy capital.And the other civ knows he's beat will offer to Capitulate.Don't vassal the civ until AFTER you've taken the capital otherwise the culture war will be a constant irritation in later turns ("[BOLD]An Indian revolt is taking place in Madras...[\BOLD]").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*Having and acquiring Vassals allows you to run a more precise offense allowing you to cut down dramatically on Domination and Conquest wins.Taking the same six city example from above, let us simply score 1 city as one point and 1 population as 1 point.The first war takes your base of six to nine, a 50% increase in lands directly held to you, plus you get half of your Vassal points (1.5), which in this grossly simplified score gets you a total point score of 10.5 as opposed to 9.The second Vassal would take your base score to 12 points with an additional 3 coming from your Vassals, totaling 15.The third Vassal war would take you to a 15 point base with an additional 4.5 from your Vassals bring the total up to: 19.5. In this case your Vassals are increasing your score by about 30%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities:[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]You[TAB][TAB]Vassal 1[TAB]Vassal 2[TAB]Vassal 3[TAB]Total pts.[NEWLINE]Start[TAB][TAB]6 / 6pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 pts(+0%)[NEWLINE]War 1[TAB]9 / 9pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]10.5pts (+16%)[NEWLINE]War 2[TAB]12 / 12pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]6 /-[TAB][TAB]15pts (+25%)[NEWLINE]War 3[TAB]15 / 15pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pts[TAB]3 / 1.5pt[TAB]19.5pts (+30%)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not to shabby in my opinion.And this of course neglects any expansion done by the Vassals after Vassalization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]*To follow up on the preceding point about running a precise offense.The strategy is that if one is able and willing to accept Vassals then the volume of necessary fighting that you'll have to do will be reduced, therefore lowering the costs of the war in time and material. Why waste time conquering an empire of 20 cities if you only have to take the six best ones to impose a favorable peace?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Superpowers and Hyperpowers and General Compaints:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Vassal system turned on, the larger the map and the more Civs in the game, there is a much greater tendency for the formations of [BOLD]Super[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Hyper-powers[\BOLD]. Without the Vassal system you could expect to see a web of Mutual Defense Pacts, even occasionally some Permanent Alliances, for a real life example think back to pre-World War One days with the complicated networking of treaties. But, with the Vassal system you can expect the AI's to cluster together with a strong Civ achieving dominance over one, or several, rival Civs which can be aligned against you. A real life example, the Soviet Union and it's client states during the Cold War. With the Vassal system the same advantages which the player can exploit, can also be exploited by the AI, with the results being a patchwork of regional and super powers developing on the map.Which probably bears some relation to Medieval Europe in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the [BOLD]Hyperpower[\BOLD] situation, you have one Civ with a relatively large expansion of it's own, coupled with not just one or several Vassals, but with a great many Vassal client states, each sufficiently developed in their own right.Hopefully, this is the player being the Hyperpower and not the AI.One can be forgiven for thinking that this would have a chilling effect on wars breaking out, or at least if war did break out it would be the Hyperpower looking to expand.However, this isn't always the case.A regional superpower or even separate (yet diplomatically close) Civs may try to break up the emerging or developing Hyperpower by launching a Pre-Emptive attack.Usually you can expect to see this happen once you start seeing the "You've grown too powerful for us" diplomatic response to even the simplest of trades.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the many frequent complaints about the Vassal system is that it can be a deterrent for warmongering, "I can't attack him without declaring war on his master and other Vassals" etc. etc., usually followed by some comment about the system being "broken." [BOLD]It's not broken, you just don't like the result[\BOLD].I can attest to the aggravation of being sidled up next to an emerging hyper power and not being able to have done anything about it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What feels eminently worse though, is when you attack another Civ, take a chunk and declare peace with the intent of re-declaring war after a short respite and chucklehead has gone off and Voluntarily become a Vassal of someone you don't really want to tangle with.[BOLD]Again, it's aggravating but the system isn't broke, we just don't like the outcome[\BOLD].If anything it's working perfectly when your victim does this as he maintains a chance at independence and keeps you from gobbling him up. Cheeky monkey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other major complaint I see cropping up from the Vassal system is that it encourages a Warmongering Strategy at the expense of a "Builder's" strategy (i.e., Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories).Ironically this is pretty much the exact opposite of the above complaint but whatever.If anything it is equally likely that a network of known treaties and Vassals would encourage peacefully strategies, especially if no Civ groupings can think they can take on and prevail against it's rival Civ groupings, thus creating a Cold War situation.As always, you must be prepared for war in order to secure peace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An aside: it is the scoring system that is nerfed, not the Vassal system.The scoring system heavily factors Time / Turns Elapsed over Type of victory.Since Cultural, Diplomatic and Space Race Victories only become possible in the late game the higher scoring games will come about primarily through War Mongering, a great great many game will end before even the option to score a Diplomatic win becomes available (let alone Space Race).A retuning of the scoring system would clear up most of the "balancing issues" in terms of strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Outsanding Questions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE](For which if someone could locate in the xml's or wherever I would be gratefull to know the answers to)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Maintenance?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the formula for Vassal Happiness boost to Master?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]References:[NEWLINE]The Civilopedia[NEWLINE]v2.08 Patch info by Thunderfall[NEWLINE]Me</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Great People Points Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Vol[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There seems to be a lot of confusion about great people, how they are generated and the odds involved, so I thought I'd try to explain that a bit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]1. Generating Great People[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Great people are generated by accumulating great people points (GPPs) in your cities. Every city has its own counter that keeps track of how many GPPs have been produced in that city already, which can be seen in the lower right corner of the city screen. Once a city has reached a specific threshold, a great person will be generated, and the GPP counter of that city will be reset to zero. This threshold is a civ-wide one, and will increase each time a great person is born so that the next one will be harder to get.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For normal game speed, you need 100 GPPs in one of your cities to generate your first great person. From then on, every great person thereafter will cost you an additional 100 GPPs until 1000, then the threshold will be increased by 200 for every great person, making it even harder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So you need 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, then 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, ... GPPs to generate a new great person.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Epic game speed, you need 150% of the required GPPs, so it's 150, 300, 450, 600, ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Quick game speed, you need only 67% of the required GPPs, so it's 67, 134, 201, ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note again that the threshold is civ-wide and the same for all cities, while the GPP counter is individual for each city. For example, you have city A with 80 GPPs and +2 GPPs per turn, and another city B at 99 GPPs and +3 GPPs per turn. So city B will reach the threshold of 100 GPPs next turn. This will produce your first great person, and sets the GPP counter of city B back to 2 (2 excess GPPs are carried over). Additionally, the new threshold for producing a great person is set to 200, so city A, now at 82 GPPs +2 GPPs per turn, will need much longer than before to produce a great person![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the question whether it's better to concentrate all your GPP production in one city, or spread it over multiple cities, see an article by Vol here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=142704.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that you will also receive specific great persons if you are the first to discover certain techs (Music, Economics, Physics, ...). This does not effect the threshold for your GPP production in any way. The same is true for great people generated by other civs: They won't effect your threshold either.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]2. Sources for GPPs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Normally, a city won't produce any GPPs on its own. There are two sources to produce GPPs, specialists and wonders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialists produce +3 GPPs per turn, except the citizen specialist which will produce none. Great wonders generally produce +2 GPPs per turn, and small wonders +1 GPP per turn. Once a wonder becomes obsolete, it will no longer produce any GPPs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These GPPs per turn can be further boosted by "+x% birth rate" enhancers. The most obvious one is if you play a philosophical leader, which provides +100% birth rate for all cities. Then there's the Pacifism civic that comes with Philosophy, which adds +100% birth rate for all cities as well. Finally, there are some wonders that provide a similar bonus, like the Parthenon (+50% birth rate for all cities) and the National Epic (+100% birth rate for the city it was built in only). Note that these boni are additive, so if you are a Philosophical leader, have adopted Pacifism and have the Parthenon, you will get +250% GPP production in all cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. Odds to Get a Specific Type of Great Person[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are five types of great persons: Engineers, merchants, scientists, prophets, and artists. The odds of which type of great person will be generated once one of your cities has produced enough GPPs, depends on which types of sources contributed to the GPP pool of that city. The odds can be displayed by mousing over the GPP bar in the lower right corner of the city screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each type of specialist counts as one source for the respective great person type, and each wonder has noted in its description which type of source it is. For example, the Great Library counts as a source for great scientists, while the Parthenon counts as a source for great artists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have produced only one type of GPPs in your city once it has reached the threshold, then you are guaranteed to get a great person of that type. For example, if your city has the Parthenon (source for great artists) and you had hired an artist specialist to increase GPP production, you will be guaranteed to get a great artist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have different types of GPP sources, it gets a little more complicated. For each turn, the game notes what types of sources had produced GPPs in the city (regardless of how many GPPs each source had contributed!). This determines the odds of which type of great person would be produced [BOLD]for that turn[\BOLD]. The overall odds are the average values of all the turns since the last great person was generated in that city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that difference: The number of [BOLD]GPPs[\BOLD] will determine [BOLD]when[\BOLD] a great person will be generated, and the number of [BOLD]sources[\BOLD] will determine [BOLD]what[\BOLD] type it will be.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Examples:[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* You have the Parthenon (great artist source) and a priest specialist (great prophet source) in the city the whole time. Your chances will be 50% to get a great artist and 50% to get a great prophet. Note that it's irrelevant that the Parthenon produced only 2 GPPs while the priest produced 3 GPPs per turn; they both count as one source.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* A city has the Great Library (great scientist source), an engineer, and an artist specialist, plus the two free scientist specialists from the Great Library. So you have 5 sources (one wonder and four specialists). This will give you a 3/5 = 60% chance of getting a great scientist, a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great artist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* You have the Pyramids (great engineer source) in a city. One turn before the city reaches the threshold to produce a great person, you hire a scientist. What happens? Well, the game remembers that for every turn but the last, the great engineer source had been the only source of GPPs, and that only on the last turn there had been a different source present. So it is a 100% chance of getting a great engineer during all turns but the last, and a 50%/50% chance for the last turn. Since it averages the odds over all the turns, you will have a 99% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1% chance of getting a great scientist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* Assuming normal game speed, no great person generated yet: You hire a priest specialist for 22 turns. Then you fire him, and hire two scientist specialists for 11 turns. Intuitively, one would assume that because you had 22*1=22 sources for a great prophet and 11*2=22 sources for a great scientist, this would give you a 50%/50% chance. But because the game averages over turns, the odds will be 22/33 = 67% for a great prophet and 11/33=33% for a great scientist instead, because you had 22 turns with only great prophet sources and 11 turns with only great scientist sources.[NEWLINE](Thanks to Roland Johansen for suggesting this!)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the threshold is reached and a great person is generated, the city "forgets" which types of sources there had been before and starts anew. So if you hire a scientist to produce a great scientist, and after generating that great scientist remove the scientist specialist and hire a priest instead, you will have a 100% chance of getting a great prophet as the next great person, since the city will have forgotten that there had been a great scientist source in the city during the previous cycle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have comments, questions, or found any mistakes, feel free to comment!</English>

Your chances will be 50% to get a great artist and 50% to get a great prophet. Note that it's irrelevant that the Parthenon produced only 2 GPPs while the priest produced 3 GPPs per turn; they both count as one source.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* A city has the Great Library (great scientist source), an engineer, and an artist specialist, plus the two free scientist specialists from the Great Library. So you have 5 sources (one wonder and four specialists). This will give you a 3/5 = 60% chance of getting a great scientist, a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great artist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* You have the Pyramids (great engineer source) in a city. One turn before the city reaches the threshold to produce a great person, you hire a scientist. What happens? Well, the game remembers that for every turn but the last, the great engineer source had been the only source of GPPs, and that only on the last turn there had been a different source present. So it is a 100% chance of getting a great engineer during all turns but the last, and a 50%/50% chance for the last turn. Since it averages the odds over all the turns, you will have a 99% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1% chance of getting a great scientist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* Assuming normal game speed, no great person generated yet: You hire a priest specialist for 22 turns. Then you fire him, and hire two scientist specialists for 11 turns. Intuitively, one would assume that because you had 22*1=22 sources for a great prophet and 11*2=22 sources for a great scientist, this would give you a 50%/50% chance. But because the game averages over turns, the odds will be 22/33 = 67% for a great prophet and 11/33=33% for a great scientist instead, because you had 22 turns with only great prophet sources and 11 turns with only great scientist sources.[NEWLINE](Thanks to Roland Johansen for suggesting this!)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the threshold is reached and a great person is generated, the city "forgets" which types of sources there had been before and starts anew. So if you hire a scientist to produce a great scientist, and after generating that great scientist remove the scientist specialist and hire a priest instead, you will have a 100% chance of getting a great prophet as the next great person, since the city will have forgotten that there had been a great scientist source in the city during the previous cycle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have comments, questions, or found any mistakes, feel free to comment!</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Great People Points Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Vol[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There seems to be a lot of confusion about great people, how they are generated and the odds involved, so I thought I'd try to explain that a bit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]1. Generating Great People[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Great people are generated by accumulating great people points (GPPs) in your cities. Every city has its own counter that keeps track of how many GPPs have been produced in that city already, which can be seen in the lower right corner of the city screen. Once a city has reached a specific threshold, a great person will be generated, and the GPP counter of that city will be reset to zero. This threshold is a civ-wide one, and will increase each time a great person is born so that the next one will be harder to get.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For normal game speed, you need 100 GPPs in one of your cities to generate your first great person. From then on, every great person thereafter will cost you an additional 100 GPPs until 1000, then the threshold will be increased by 200 for every great person, making it even harder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So you need 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, then 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, ... GPPs to generate a new great person.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Epic game speed, you need 150% of the required GPPs, so it's 150, 300, 450, 600, ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Quick game speed, you need only 67% of the required GPPs, so it's 67, 134, 201, ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note again that the threshold is civ-wide and the same for all cities, while the GPP counter is individual for each city. For example, you have city A with 80 GPPs and +2 GPPs per turn, and another city B at 99 GPPs and +3 GPPs per turn. So city B will reach the threshold of 100 GPPs next turn. This will produce your first great person, and sets the GPP counter of city B back to 2 (2 excess GPPs are carried over). Additionally, the new threshold for producing a great person is set to 200, so city A, now at 82 GPPs +2 GPPs per turn, will need much longer than before to produce a great person![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the question whether it's better to concentrate all your GPP production in one city, or spread it over multiple cities, see an article by Vol here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=142704.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that you will also receive specific great persons if you are the first to discover certain techs (Music, Economics, Physics, ...). This does not effect the threshold for your GPP production in any way. The same is true for great people generated by other civs: They won't effect your threshold either.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]2. Sources for GPPs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Normally, a city won't produce any GPPs on its own. There are two sources to produce GPPs, specialists and wonders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialists produce +3 GPPs per turn, except the citizen specialist which will produce none. Great wonders generally produce +2 GPPs per turn, and small wonders +1 GPP per turn. Once a wonder becomes obsolete, it will no longer produce any GPPs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These GPPs per turn can be further boosted by "+x% birth rate" enhancers. The most obvious one is if you play a philosophical leader, which provides +100% birth rate for all cities. Then there's the Pacifism civic that comes with Philosophy, which adds +100% birth rate for all cities as well. Finally, there are some wonders that provide a similar bonus, like the Parthenon (+50% birth rate for all cities) and the National Epic (+100% birth rate for the city it was built in only). Note that these boni are additive, so if you are a Philosophical leader, have adopted Pacifism and have the Parthenon, you will get +250% GPP production in all cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. Odds to Get a Specific Type of Great Person[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are five types of great persons: Engineers, merchants, scientists, prophets, and artists. The odds of which type of great person will be generated once one of your cities has produced enough GPPs, depends on which types of sources contributed to the GPP pool of that city. The odds can be displayed by mousing over the GPP bar in the lower right corner of the city screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each type of specialist counts as one source for the respective great person type, and each wonder has noted in its description which type of source it is. For example, the Great Library counts as a source for great scientists, while the Parthenon counts as a source for great artists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have produced only one type of GPPs in your city once it has reached the threshold, then you are guaranteed to get a great person of that type. For example, if your city has the Parthenon (source for great artists) and you had hired an artist specialist to increase GPP production, you will be guaranteed to get a great artist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have different types of GPP sources, it gets a little more complicated. For each turn, the game notes what types of sources had produced GPPs in the city (regardless of how many GPPs each source had contributed!). This determines the odds of which type of great person would be produced [BOLD]for that turn[\BOLD]. The overall odds are the average values of all the turns since the last great person was generated in that city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that difference: The number of [BOLD]GPPs[\BOLD] will determine [BOLD]when[\BOLD] a great person will be generated, and the number of [BOLD]sources[\BOLD] will determine [BOLD]what[\BOLD] type it will be.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Examples:[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* You have the Parthenon (great artist source) and a priest specialist (great prophet source) in the city the whole time. Your chances will be 50% to get a great artist and 50% to get a great prophet. Note that it's irrelevant that the Parthenon produced only 2 GPPs while the priest produced 3 GPPs per turn; they both count as one source.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* A city has the Great Library (great scientist source), an engineer, and an artist specialist, plus the two free scientist specialists from the Great Library. So you have 5 sources (one wonder and four specialists). This will give you a 3/5 = 60% chance of getting a great scientist, a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1/5 = 20% chance of getting a great artist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* You have the Pyramids (great engineer source) in a city. One turn before the city reaches the threshold to produce a great person, you hire a scientist. What happens? Well, the game remembers that for every turn but the last, the great engineer source had been the only source of GPPs, and that only on the last turn there had been a different source present. So it is a 100% chance of getting a great engineer during all turns but the last, and a 50%/50% chance for the last turn. Since it averages the odds over all the turns, you will have a 99% chance of getting a great engineer, and a 1% chance of getting a great scientist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]* Assuming normal game speed, no great person generated yet: You hire a priest specialist for 22 turns. Then you fire him, and hire two scientist specialists for 11 turns. Intuitively, one would assume that because you had 22*1=22 sources for a great prophet and 11*2=22 sources for a great scientist, this would give you a 50%/50% chance. But because the game averages over turns, the odds will be 22/33 = 67% for a great prophet and 11/33=33% for a great scientist instead, because you had 22 turns with only great prophet sources and 11 turns with only great scientist sources.[NEWLINE](Thanks to Roland Johansen for suggesting this!)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the threshold is reached and a great person is generated, the city "forgets" which types of sources there had been before and starts anew. So if you hire a scientist to produce a great scientist, and after generating that great scientist remove the scientist specialist and hire a priest instead, you will have a 100% chance of getting a great prophet as the next great person, since the city will have forgotten that there had been a great scientist source in the city during the previous cycle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have comments, questions, or found any mistakes, feel free to comment!</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Great People Points: Focus in One City, or Distribute Across Many?[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Vol[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While playing some recent games, I became curious about whether or not it mattered if I concentrated all of my Great People Point production in one city or not. Assume that you have a finite number of points you can generate across your empire, you can either focus all of them (specialists and wonders) in one city, or across a few cities (say your three best cities).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the points required to generate a Great Person were constant (always 100), this would not be an issue. In the long run, the points would always generate the same number of great leaders. However, the points required is not constant. [ITALIC]Each Great Person costs 100 more Great People points to generate than the last.[\ITALIC][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I'm sure we've all seen, cities with a single specialist (+3 GPP/turn) steadily accumulate points, however the capital may be generating many Great People in the meantime, and thus raising the bar, [BOLD]faster than the smaller city can catch up[\BOLD]. Basically, any city that cannot produce 100 Great People Points in the time it takes for the biggest cities to generate another Great Person [BOLD]will never produce one[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So I built a simple simulator, so I could explore the dynamics. These are the assumptions/parameters I used:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Three cities, with a finite number of Great People Points distributed across them. For simplicity, I chose 30 Great People Points to distribute.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I defined a parameter, [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC], which describes the distribution of those points. Basically, its the ratio of the the points in one city to the others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For example:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 1, the cities have 10, 10, 10.[NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 2, the cities have 15, 7.5, 7.5.[NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 3, the cities have 18, 6, 6.[NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 10, the cities have 25, 2.5, 2.5.[NEWLINE]As [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] approaches infinity, the cities have 30, 0, 0.[NEWLINE][BOLD]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] is larger, you have one city that has much more Great People Points production than the other cities.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 0.5, the cities have 6, 12, 12.[NEWLINE]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 0.1, the cities have 1.428, 14.28, 14.28.[NEWLINE]As [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] approaches 0, the cities have 0, 15, 15.[NEWLINE][BOLD]If [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] is smaller, you have one city that has fewer Great People Points than the other cities.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]- I ran the simulation and measured the number of turns required to generate 20 Great People, and then normalized the data about [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Here is the result:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ4/strategy/Great_People_Points_Distribution.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Please note the use of a logarithmic x-axis, and the y-axis is zoomed in. Lower is better, as this denotes fewer turns required to generate the same number of Great People.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Some observations to make:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]No distribution of Great People Points can help you or harm you by more than about 8%.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The sporadic behavior is caused by cases where cities are unable to "catch-up" to the increasing point total required to generate a Great Person.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]At around [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] &lt; 0.2, the city with less Great People points is never able to generate a Great Person, as the required total number of points increases faster than the city can accumulate points. Thus, beyond this point, it is better to use those Great People Points to speed up the other cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]At round [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] &gt; 10, the same thing happens in reverse. The other two cities are now never able to generate a Great Person since the primary city is outpacing them and moving the required total faster than they can generate points. At this point, it is better to focus on the one city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Both extremes approach asymptotic limits[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]There is a [BOLD]dangerous[\BOLD] break-point near [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 10 where the primary city gains one more Great People Point and now the required total points is outpacing the other cities, reducing Civ-wide Great People production by 16%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This case assumed that there were no boosts to Great People Point production. Most boosts are empire-wide (Parthenon, Philosophical, Pacificist), and thus the [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] value is unchanged (all numbers get bigger, but the ratios stay the same, you have 60 points to distribute instead of 30).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]However, the National Epic boosts Great People Points by 100% in just one city.[\BOLD] Let's see how that impacts the distribution of points:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ4/strategy/Great_People_Points_Distribution_National_Epic.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We basically see the exact same behavior, but it has been "tilted" and moved to the left by 2x with the impact of the National Epic's 100% multiplier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Now we see some more interesting, and expected, behavior:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The total difference in points (from having no Great People Points in the city with the National Epic, to having all Great People Points in a city with the National Epic) is a factor of 2 (60% to 120%).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Individual break-points relating to cities being unable to catch up to the pace still has an effect of about 10%.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Focusing all of your Great People Points in one city is the way to go[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The big jump-point where no other city can produce a Great Person due to the run-away primary city now occurs at [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 4. That is, the primary city is generating 20 points (40 with National Epic), and the other two cities are generating 5 points. It takes 2.5 turns to generate 100 points for the primary city, and 20 turns to generate 100 points for the other cities at that point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]In summary[\BOLD], in the reasonable range of [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC], there is a potential to increase your Great People production by 20% to 30% if you focus your Specialists and Wonders in one city with the National Epic. Other cities will be able to produce Great People, up until a point. If you get many Wonders and Specialists in your National Epic city, you may gain [BOLD]no Great People[\BOLD] from having a single specialist or wonder in another city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]As with most other game systems in Civ4, its all about specialization.[\BOLD] Having jack-of-all-trades cities is [ITALIC]significantly less efficient[\ITALIC].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little more detail on cities trying to catch-up to a pace-setting primary city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here's an example off of the National Epic curve, where d = 5.25 and within the scope of a game, the other cities are never able to generate a Great Person.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ4/strategy/Great_People_Points_Timeline.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, the required number of points goes with the square root of turns, while the accumulated points for any city goes linearly with turns, so there is [ITALIC]always[\ITALIC] [BOLD]some point in time[\BOLD] where a city [BOLD]will[\BOLD] generate a Great Person. Its just that with a sufficiently fast primary city, this point in time may exceed the 400 turn limit of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here's an example of d = 2.0 (primary city has 15 points [30 with National Epic], the two secondary cities have 7.5 points).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ4/strategy/Great_People_Points_Timeline_d21.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here we see that the secondary cities produce 4 Great People, and the primary city produces 16 Great People.

Thus, beyond this point, it is better to use those Great People Points to speed up the other cities.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]At round [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] &gt; 10, the same thing happens in reverse. The other two cities are now never able to generate a Great Person since the primary city is outpacing them and moving the required total faster than they can generate points. At this point, it is better to focus on the one city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Both extremes approach asymptotic limits[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]There is a [BOLD]dangerous[\BOLD] break-point near [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 10 where the primary city gains one more Great People Point and now the required total points is outpacing the other cities, reducing Civ-wide Great People production by 16%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This case assumed that there were no boosts to Great People Point production. Most boosts are empire-wide (Parthenon, Philosophical, Pacificist), and thus the [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] value is unchanged (all numbers get bigger, but the ratios stay the same, you have 60 points to distribute instead of 30).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]However, the National Epic boosts Great People Points by 100% in just one city.[\BOLD] Let's see how that impacts the distribution of points:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chart: http://www.civfanatics.com/images/civ4/strategy/Great_People_Points_Distribution_National_Epic.jpg (Open in external web browser)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]We basically see the exact same behavior, but it has been "tilted" and moved to the left by 2x with the impact of the National Epic's 100% multiplier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Now we see some more interesting, and expected, behavior:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The total difference in points (from having no Great People Points in the city with the National Epic, to having all Great People Points in a city with the National Epic) is a factor of 2 (60% to 120%).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Individual break-points relating to cities being unable to catch up to the pace still has an effect of about 10%.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Focusing all of your Great People Points in one city is the way to go[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The big jump-point where no other city can produce a Great Person due to the run-away primary city now occurs at [ITALIC]d[\ITALIC] = 4.

		<Italian>[H1]Great People Points: Focus in One City, or Distribute Across Many?[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Vol[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While playing some recent games, I became curious about whether or not it mattered if I concentrated all of my Great People Point production in one city or not. Assume that you have a finite number of points you can generate across your empire, you can either focus all of them (specialists and wonders) in one city, or across a few cities (say your three best cities).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the points required to generate a Great Person were constant (always 100), this would not be an issue. In the long run, the points would always generate the same number of great leaders. However, the points required is not constant. [ITALIC]Each Great Person costs 100 more Great People points to generate than the last.[\ITALIC][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As I'm sure we've all seen, cities with a single specialist (+3 GPP/turn) steadily accumulate points, however the capital may be generating many Great People in the meantime, and thus raising the bar, [BOLD]faster than the smaller city can catch up[\BOLD].

		<English>[H1]Subsidies and Aggressive Trading Practices[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Hans Lemurson[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The following is a strategy for getting the most out of your GPT trades with the AI.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Have you often been in annoying situations with the AI, wanting to sell off a resource, but getting only a pittance in return? Is silk [BOLD]really[\BOLD] worth only 3 GPT?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It turns out that the AI also values these resources more than they are paying, but are limited to only giving away as much GPT as they are currently making in profit. One of the most striking features of this is the fact that the AI always seems be willing to trade all of its available GPT for your goods, whether it is 1 or 5. How would you like to make 7, 9, or 12 GPT regularly [BOLD]per resource[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Well now you can! All it takes is a little patience, and plenty of extra goods, and you'll be in bushiness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The primary limit on an AI's GPT trading is simply the size of their positive cash-flow that turn. There is a secondary limit based on how much they like you, but you don't often hit it. In order to trade as much GPT as possible with the AI, you have to make sure that they have enough GPT to cover the transaction. How do you do this? Subsidize them![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Subsidies:[\BOLD] If you gift GPT to an AI in negotiations, it will (as you might expect) raise their GPT in turn. Gift an AI GPT in small increments until their Available GPT stops increasing. You have just determined their trading limit, and they will now be willing to buy resources off you at top dollar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Here is an example scenario:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Suppose I was trading with the Persians, and they are listed as having 4 Available GPT.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 2 GPT, and their Available-GPT rises to 6.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 2 GPT again, and now their Available-GPT rises to 7.[NEWLINE]Where did the money go?[NEWLINE]They are simply not willing to trade at 8 GPT; their limit is 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I now sell them Furs for 7 GPT, and now their Available-GPT is at 1.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 7 GPT, and their Available goes to 7.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I sell them Rice for 7GPT, and their Available is down to 1 again.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I see that I can only sell 1 more resource to them, Silk, and so I gift them 6 GPT. Their Available is at 7.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I sell them the Silk for 7 GPT, and call it a day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are all probably noticing that throughout this entire affair, I'm only making a profit of 4 GPT while selling them 3 resources. I'm effectively giving them 2 resources for free! That is however, why it is called a [BOLD]subsidy[\BOLD]. You don't make a profit just yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Making your profit:[\BOLD] For the first 10 turns of your trading agreement, you'll be getting the short end of the stick. That now changes, because after 10 turns, you can cancel trade agreements! You are currently subsidizing the purchase of your goods at a cost of 17 GPT, but once the 10 turn limit expires, you can cancel these. Now, you are turning a nice healthy profit of 21 GPT from resource trading, not too shabby. The best part comes from the fact that you can do this [BOLD]with every civilization[\BOLD], resource sourpusses permitting. I have personally been able to break 100 GPT in trade-profits using this method.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Things to watch for:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If your potential partner's Available GPT is listed as 0, they are probably in deficit spending. Don't bother trading with them, since you'll have to subsidize them out of their deficit before negotiations can even begin, and you have [BOLD]no idea[\BOLD] how much that's going to take. 5 GPT? 10? You have no way of knowing, and it will be expensive no matter what.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]You [BOLD]yourself[\BOLD] need a positive cash-flow before you can gift people GPT. To be on the safe side, set your science spending to 0% before entering negotiations.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always sell to the highest bidder. Search around for who has the highest trading limit, and choose to trade with them first. This will make sure that you get the most out of the sale of your resources. Trading limits correlate pretty strongly with the Civ's attitude towards you, so you can be making 12-15 GPT per resource from your close allies.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]As nations become friendlier with you over time, their trading limits will begin to rise. If you suspect this to be the case, you can cancel your trades and renegotiate. Their Available GPT will rise in accordance with their suddenly reduced expenses, and will still be available to you for buying your goods. If, in the Persian example, after a while the trading limit rises to 8, you renegotiate to sell them the first two resources for 8 GPT apiece, but you will probably have to subsidize the third. No problem there, since subsidies are a 0 net-loss, so for the first 10 turns, you will just be making 21 GPT. Once that's up, you can cancel the subsidy and come up to 24 GPT, making the whole thing worthwhile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I do not believe this to be too much of an exploit, since the AIs have their own personal spending limits anyway, and are perfectly willing to pay that much for the resource. Furthermore, it seems stupid in retrospect to be selling your wheat off for 1 or 2 GPT. This tactic simply gets the AI to trade at their maximum trading level for as many resources as you have to offer. Now it might be theoretically possible to cause serious economic harm to a Civ when you cut off their subsidies, but that's why this is called [BOLD]Aggressive[\BOLD] Trading. You make them trade to their very limit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Additional Uses for Subsidies:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. Extortion: ([BOLD]Edit:[\BOLD] This has not been thoroughly tested and appears to deliver rather poorer results were originally though.)[NEWLINE]All GPT deals are restricted by the amount of Available GPT the AI has in stock. Subsidizing allows you to bypass this limit, and so opens up a new world of options, namely "Coercive Bargaining" or "Protection Fees".[NEWLINE]How to make use of this?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Get a Large and Threatening(tm) army.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Look for a weak Civ somewhere in the world, who you think might like to "stay in bushiness", but might be too much hassle to "take care of" yourself.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Having selected your victim, gift them enough gold up to their trading limit, to ease open their finances.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Demand a repayment in kind, but for as large a sum as possible (you are limited to their trade-limit).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the first "trade" was not enough, try this again and again to see how much you can squeeze out of the little sucker. You may have to keep pumping them up with GPT so that they can afford your demands. ([BOLD]Tests show that AIs rarely if ever agreed to demands twice in a row. Yields are probably limited to 1 trading-limit's worth.[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]After 10 turns are up, go ahead and cancel [BOLD]your[\BOLD] side of the bargain, but their tribute will still be coming in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I won't even pretend this is not an exploit, since any sensible player would cancel their tribute to an AI guilt-free after 10 turns were up. This will theoretically allow you to soak your victim nations for a significantly larger chunk of change than you could normally, since a 0GPT in diplomacy can't limit the tribute. The AI will faithfully send it's moneys to you basically forever once the deal is made, ending only if one of you declares war on the other. The best part about this is that you don't need to actually [BOLD]have[\BOLD] any other resources than just a large military. Your relationship may suffer, but do you really care? If they don't like paying, then you can just tax them like normal citizens of your empire (after you 'assist' their citizenship).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Edit: Many questions have come up as to "How do I cancel my deals?". Due to some bug, it seems to be impossible to cancel a GPT loan in the diplomacy window with another Civ (it prompts to change the amount given, but then does nothing). To cancel these deals, you go to your foreign advisor (F3), and look under the "Active" section. This will show all current deals you have, and mousing over them will reveal how many turns until they can be cancelled. Click on a matured deal and you will be asked whether you wish to cancel it (y/n).[\BOLD]</English>

		<Italian>[H1]Subsidies and Aggressive Trading Practices[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Hans Lemurson[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The following is a strategy for getting the most out of your GPT trades with the AI.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Have you often been in annoying situations with the AI, wanting to sell off a resource, but getting only a pittance in return? Is silk [BOLD]really[\BOLD] worth only 3 GPT?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It turns out that the AI also values these resources more than they are paying, but are limited to only giving away as much GPT as they are currently making in profit. One of the most striking features of this is the fact that the AI always seems be willing to trade all of its available GPT for your goods, whether it is 1 or 5. How would you like to make 7, 9, or 12 GPT regularly [BOLD]per resource[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Well now you can! All it takes is a little patience, and plenty of extra goods, and you'll be in bushiness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The primary limit on an AI's GPT trading is simply the size of their positive cash-flow that turn. There is a secondary limit based on how much they like you, but you don't often hit it. In order to trade as much GPT as possible with the AI, you have to make sure that they have enough GPT to cover the transaction. How do you do this? Subsidize them![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Subsidies:[\BOLD] If you gift GPT to an AI in negotiations, it will (as you might expect) raise their GPT in turn. Gift an AI GPT in small increments until their Available GPT stops increasing. You have just determined their trading limit, and they will now be willing to buy resources off you at top dollar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Here is an example scenario:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Suppose I was trading with the Persians, and they are listed as having 4 Available GPT.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 2 GPT, and their Available-GPT rises to 6.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 2 GPT again, and now their Available-GPT rises to 7.[NEWLINE]Where did the money go?[NEWLINE]They are simply not willing to trade at 8 GPT; their limit is 7.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I now sell them Furs for 7 GPT, and now their Available-GPT is at 1.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I gift them 7 GPT, and their Available goes to 7.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I sell them Rice for 7GPT, and their Available is down to 1 again.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I see that I can only sell 1 more resource to them, Silk, and so I gift them 6 GPT. Their Available is at 7.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]I sell them the Silk for 7 GPT, and call it a day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You are all probably noticing that throughout this entire affair, I'm only making a profit of 4 GPT while selling them 3 resources. I'm effectively giving them 2 resources for free! That is however, why it is called a [BOLD]subsidy[\BOLD]. You don't make a profit just yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Making your profit:[\BOLD] For the first 10 turns of your trading agreement, you'll be getting the short end of the stick. That now changes, because after 10 turns, you can cancel trade agreements! You are currently subsidizing the purchase of your goods at a cost of 17 GPT, but once the 10 turn limit expires, you can cancel these. Now, you are turning a nice healthy profit of 21 GPT from resource trading, not too shabby. The best part comes from the fact that you can do this [BOLD]with every civilization[\BOLD], resource sourpusses permitting. I have personally been able to break 100 GPT in trade-profits using this method.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Things to watch for:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If your potential partner's Available GPT is listed as 0, they are probably in deficit spending. Don't bother trading with them, since you'll have to subsidize them out of their deficit before negotiations can even begin, and you have [BOLD]no idea[\BOLD] how much that's going to take. 5 GPT? 10? You have no way of knowing, and it will be expensive no matter what.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]You [BOLD]yourself[\BOLD] need a positive cash-flow before you can gift people GPT. To be on the safe side, set your science spending to 0% before entering negotiations.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Always sell to the highest bidder. Search around for who has the highest trading limit, and choose to trade with them first. This will make sure that you get the most out of the sale of your resources. Trading limits correlate pretty strongly with the Civ's attitude towards you, so you can be making 12-15 GPT per resource from your close allies.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]As nations become friendlier with you over time, their trading limits will begin to rise. If you suspect this to be the case, you can cancel your trades and renegotiate. Their Available GPT will rise in accordance with their suddenly reduced expenses, and will still be available to you for buying your goods. If, in the Persian example, after a while the trading limit rises to 8, you renegotiate to sell them the first two resources for 8 GPT apiece, but you will probably have to subsidize the third. No problem there, since subsidies are a 0 net-loss, so for the first 10 turns, you will just be making 21 GPT. Once that's up, you can cancel the subsidy and come up to 24 GPT, making the whole thing worthwhile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I do not believe this to be too much of an exploit, since the AIs have their own personal spending limits anyway, and are perfectly willing to pay that much for the resource. Furthermore, it seems stupid in retrospect to be selling your wheat off for 1 or 2 GPT. This tactic simply gets the AI to trade at their maximum trading level for as many resources as you have to offer. Now it might be theoretically possible to cause serious economic harm to a Civ when you cut off their subsidies, but that's why this is called [BOLD]Aggressive[\BOLD] Trading. You make them trade to their very limit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Additional Uses for Subsidies:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. Extortion: ([BOLD]Edit:[\BOLD] This has not been thoroughly tested and appears to deliver rather poorer results were originally though.)[NEWLINE]All GPT deals are restricted by the amount of Available GPT the AI has in stock. Subsidizing allows you to bypass this limit, and so opens up a new world of options, namely "Coercive Bargaining" or "Protection Fees".[NEWLINE]How to make use of this?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Get a Large and Threatening(tm) army.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Look for a weak Civ somewhere in the world, who you think might like to "stay in bushiness", but might be too much hassle to "take care of" yourself.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Having selected your victim, gift them enough gold up to their trading limit, to ease open their finances.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Demand a repayment in kind, but for as large a sum as possible (you are limited to their trade-limit).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If the first "trade" was not enough, try this again and again to see how much you can squeeze out of the little sucker. You may have to keep pumping them up with GPT so that they can afford your demands. ([BOLD]Tests show that AIs rarely if ever agreed to demands twice in a row. Yields are probably limited to 1 trading-limit's worth.[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]After 10 turns are up, go ahead and cancel [BOLD]your[\BOLD] side of the bargain, but their tribute will still be coming in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I won't even pretend this is not an exploit, since any sensible player would cancel their tribute to an AI guilt-free after 10 turns were up. This will theoretically allow you to soak your victim nations for a significantly larger chunk of change than you could normally, since a 0GPT in diplomacy can't limit the tribute. The AI will faithfully send it's moneys to you basically forever once the deal is made, ending only if one of you declares war on the other. The best part about this is that you don't need to actually [BOLD]have[\BOLD] any other resources than just a large military. Your relationship may suffer, but do you really care? If they don't like paying, then you can just tax them like normal citizens of your empire (after you 'assist' their citizenship).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Edit: Many questions have come up as to "How do I cancel my deals?". Due to some bug, it seems to be impossible to cancel a GPT loan in the diplomacy window with another Civ (it prompts to change the amount given, but then does nothing).

		<English>[H1]Technology Research Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Requies[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Research. It's the fundamental way of advancing in life and in Civ IV, and a necessary part of making your way up the food chain in Civ IV from doormat to winner (whether via space race, diplomacy, conquest, or culture). Unfortunately, it's also the way to figure out how research actually works in Civ IV.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately for you all, I've done all that. This article came about because I was interested in what the optimal start to the game was. However, upon working out that information, I was startled to discover that the amount of research differed from what my lone city was producing. I dug further in depth into the mechanisms of the game and figured out how research is priced, accumulated, and applied in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article will explain the ins and outs of how your beakers get put to work to research the technologies that make or break your game of Civ. To learn more, read on....[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]One important note.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR means rounding DOWN to the nearest integer AND it has higher precedence than all other operators EXCEPT FOR parentheses. You will see it used a lot in the article.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The basics (of generating beakers)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Each city generates a raw amount of commerce via the squares that are being worked and the trade routes in the cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) This commerce is in turn translated into beakers (research), coins (gold), or notes (culture) via the technology and culture sliders. The actual amount of beakers and notes are gained by using the specified slider rate in the following equation:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (total commerce * the specified slider rate).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The remainder is then given in gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So, yes, you WILL get AT LEAST one gold from each city that has a commerce that is not a multiple of 10, if your science or culture is not 100%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Each city then takes each amount and adds in any additional sources of research, gold, or culture (via shrines, production processes, and specialists, mainly).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Each city then multiplies it by whatever modifiers it has depending on what buildings it has built (e.g., beakers are multiplied by 1.25 if it has a library, gold is multiplied by 1.5 if it has a bank, etc.). NOTE: multipliers are ADDITIVE (i.e., if you have a library and university, your beakers will be multiplied by 1.5 (1 + 0.25 + 0.25) NOT 1.5625 (1 * 1.25 * 1.25)).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) The beaker totals are then added up across the cities and the sum is your base beaker total.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Technology Costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To calculate the technology cost of a technology:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Take the base cost of the technology. (This can be found for each technology in Assets\XML\Technologies\CIV4TechInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Take the Difficulty Modifier and add 0.5 * the Number of teammates you have to it. (The difficulty modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4HandicapInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Multiply 1) by 2) and take the FLOOR of the product.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Multiply 3) by the Map Modifier and take the FLOOR of the product. (The map modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4WorldInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Multiply 4) by the Speed Modifier and take the FLOOR of the product. This generates the actual cost of the technology. (The speed modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4GameSpeedInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thus the formula to calculate a Technology's cost is:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Technology Cost[\BOLD] = FLOOR (FLOOR (FLOOR ([BOLD]Base Cost[\BOLD] * ([BOLD]Difficulty Modifier[\BOLD] + 0.5 * [BOLD]# of teammates[\BOLD])) * [BOLD]Map Modifier[\BOLD]) * [BOLD]Speed Modifier[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Applying the Research to the Technology[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The amount of beakers applied to the technology cost is dependant upon the number of civilizations which know the tech and the number of requirements you have fulfilled for the technology.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Known Civilizations w/ Tech modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Multiply 0.30 by the number of KNOWN, [BOLD]LIVING[\BOLD] civilizations, who have the tech.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Divide by the number of civilizations which STARTED on the map and ROUND DOWN to the hundredth place (0.01) of the quotient.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Add 2) to 1[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tech Known by Civilizations modifier[\BOLD] = 1 + RDDW (0.30 * [BOLD]# known Civs who have the tech[\BOLD] / [BOLD]# of Civs who started the game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Prerequisites modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Start with 1. If the technology does NOT have a minimum requirement (i.e., the starting techs = Fishing, The Wheel, Agriculture, Hunting, Mysticism, Mining), then use 1 AS the modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Add 0.2 to 1) if a Technology has a MINIMUM Requirement that the player has met. Note: Even if a tech has MANY MANDATORY PREREQUISITES, it will still only give you a boost of 1.2 because you MUST have all those prerequisites to research the tech. (IOW, the minimum requirement IS all of those prerequisites.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Add 0.2 to 2) for EACH ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL Prerequisite that the player has met.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Requirements modifier[\BOLD] = 1 + (0.2 * [BOLD]MINIMUM Req. met[\BOLD]) + (0.2 * [BOLD]# of Optional Prereq. met[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Actual Amount of Beakers Generated Toward a Tech[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To calculate the amount of beakers which you generate toward the technology:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Take the total sum of beakers generated by all your cities (the result from the basics part).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Add 1 to it if you have a city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Multiply 2) by the Known Civilizations w/ Tech modifier and take the FLOOR of the product.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Multiply 3) by Prerequisites modifier and take the FLOOR of the product.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The formula to calculate the amount of beakers applied to your technology is:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Beakers applied to Technology[\BOLD] = FLOOR (FLOOR (([BOLD]Total Base Beakers[\BOLD] + 1) * [BOLD]KCwT modifier[\BOLD]) * [BOLD]Prerequisites modifier[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]An Example:[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I always seem to understand better with an example, so here's a basic one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Say you want to research [BOLD]Code of Laws[\BOLD] which has a base cost of 350 beakers, the mandatory requirement of [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] and the optional (meaning you must research one of them) requirements of ([BOLD]Priesthood[\BOLD] or [BOLD]Currency[\BOLD]).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You know [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] and [BOLD]Priesthood[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You produce 37 net beakers per turn and you have met 3 other civilizations who know it out of 7 who started the map.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You started on a standard map (1.4 modifier) at the monarch difficulty level (1.15 modifier) at epic game speed (1.5 modifier) and have 1 teammate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Your cost would be:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (FLOOR (FLOOR (350 * (1.15 + 0.5 * 1)) * 1.4) * 1.5)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (350 * 1.65) = 577[NEWLINE]FLOOR (577 * 1.4) = 807[NEWLINE]FLOOR (807 * 1.5) = 1210[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Total cost = 1210[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The amount of beakers applied to code of laws would be:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (FLOOR ((37 + 1) * (1 + RDDW (0.30 * 3 / 7))) * (1 + 0.2 + (0.2 * 0))[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1 + RDDW (0.30 * 3 / 7) = 1.12[NEWLINE]FLOOR (38 * 1.12) = 42[NEWLINE]FLOOR (42 * 1.2) = 50[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beakers applied to Code of Laws/turn = 50[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that having [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] AND [BOLD]Priesthood[\BOLD] only gives you a bonus modifier of 1.2 because you must have at LEAST [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] PLUS one of the optional prerequisites to be able to research [BOLD]Code of Laws[\BOLD]. If you also had [BOLD]Currency[\BOLD], then the modifier would be 1.4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Overflow[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The overflow is calculated by the modifiers from the PREVIOUS Technology. Therefore, if you finished researching [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] this turn, and you had all THREE optional requirements, the overflow beakers which applied to your next technology would be equal to however many you had left USING THE MODIFIERS FOR [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] after finishing [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD]. So, your Requirements modifier would be 1.6 (1.2 * 3). So, you could conceivable get a significant boost toward your next tech OVER WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN if you have a lot of overflow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Repercussions[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) It can be VERY important to establish contact with all the other civilizations in order to speed your beakers applied count. You could potentially be making 28% (17 known civs w/ tech/ 18 civs total) more beakers than you normally could on a tech. This is especially true on harder difficulties. If you just meet half of the other civs, your research on techs known by the others would improve by 14%. This is probably the biggest repercussion of the calculation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) If you're going to research several technologies and one is an optional requirement of another, research the optional one first as that will boost your research toward the other one [BOLD]unless you have a specific reason for researching the other one[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) If you're researching the starting techs (no prerequisites modifier), try to reduce the amount of overflow you have, as you're multiplying it by the lowest amount possible. It would be better spent earning some gold which may be necessary to run a deficit research job.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) If you're researching a tech which is known by a lot of people and which has many optional prerequisites which you already have, try to time it so that you end a turn with 1 beaker left to research that tech. The next turn INCREASE the amount of commerce you generate in order to increase the research overflow on the next turn to the max amount possible. You could potentially generate 104.8% ((1 + 17 known civs w/ tech/18 civs) * 1.6 [tech w/ 3 optional prerequisites]) more beakers of overflow than you normally would for that tech (assuming it's from Writing to a Starting Tech which no one knows. I know, it's unlikely.). However, for a realistic overflow difference getting almost 46% (1.25 * 1.4 / 1.2) more beakers in overflow is very feasible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][First tech = 6 known civs w/ tech out of 7 civs and 1 additional optional prerequisite obtained][NEWLINE][Second tech = no known civs with tech and no additional optional prerequisites obtained][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]like Paper w/ Civil Service and Theology to Education.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Pre-Alphabet (and possibly in non-tech trading games), you will be able to determine the number of known players with a certain tech but not who has this specific tech unless all known or no known civs have it. (thx to DaviddesJ for pointing this out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]6) Similar to repercussion #5, if the AI is ahead of you in tech, you will be able to determine the number of known players with a technology which is BEYOND your research ability (i.e., those you do not have the prerequisite technologies for) but not who has this specific tech unless all known or no known civs have it.

		<French>[H1]Technology Research Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Requies[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Research. It's the fundamental way of advancing in life and in Civ IV, and a necessary part of making your way up the food chain in Civ IV from doormat to winner (whether via space race, diplomacy, conquest, or culture). Unfortunately, it's also the way to figure out how research actually works in Civ IV.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately for you all, I've done all that. This article came about because I was interested in what the optimal start to the game was. However, upon working out that information, I was startled to discover that the amount of research differed from what my lone city was producing. I dug further in depth into the mechanisms of the game and figured out how research is priced, accumulated, and applied in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article will explain the ins and outs of how your beakers get put to work to research the technologies that make or break your game of Civ. To learn more, read on....[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]One important note.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR means rounding DOWN to the nearest integer AND it has higher precedence than all other operators EXCEPT FOR parentheses. You will see it used a lot in the article.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The basics (of generating beakers)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Each city generates a raw amount of commerce via the squares that are being worked and the trade routes in the cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) This commerce is in turn translated into beakers (research), coins (gold), or notes (culture) via the technology and culture sliders. The actual amount of beakers and notes are gained by using the specified slider rate in the following equation:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (total commerce * the specified slider rate).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The remainder is then given in gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So, yes, you WILL get AT LEAST one gold from each city that has a commerce that is not a multiple of 10, if your science or culture is not 100%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Each city then takes each amount and adds in any additional sources of research, gold, or culture (via shrines, production processes, and specialists, mainly).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Each city then multiplies it by whatever modifiers it has depending on what buildings it has built (e.g., beakers are multiplied by 1.25 if it has a library, gold is multiplied by 1.5 if it has a bank, etc.). NOTE: multipliers are ADDITIVE (i.e., if you have a library and university, your beakers will be multiplied by 1.5 (1 + 0.25 + 0.25) NOT 1.5625 (1 * 1.25 * 1.25)).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) The beaker totals are then added up across the cities and the sum is your base beaker total.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Technology Costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To calculate the technology cost of a technology:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Take the base cost of the technology. (This can be found for each technology in Assets\XML\Technologies\CIV4TechInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Take the Difficulty Modifier and add 0.5 * the Number of teammates you have to it. (The difficulty modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4HandicapInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Multiply 1) by 2) and take the FLOOR of the product.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Multiply 3) by the Map Modifier and take the FLOOR of the product.

This generates the actual cost of the technology. (The speed modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4GameSpeedInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thus the formula to calculate a Technology's cost is:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Technology Cost[\BOLD] = FLOOR (FLOOR (FLOOR ([BOLD]Base Cost[\BOLD] * ([BOLD]Difficulty Modifier[\BOLD] + 0.5 * [BOLD]# of teammates[\BOLD])) * [BOLD]Map Modifier[\BOLD]) * [BOLD]Speed Modifier[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Applying the Research to the Technology[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The amount of beakers applied to the technology cost is dependant upon the number of civilizations which know the tech and the number of requirements you have fulfilled for the technology.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Known Civilizations w/ Tech modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Multiply 0.30 by the number of KNOWN, [BOLD]LIVING[\BOLD] civilizations, who have the tech.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Divide by the number of civilizations which STARTED on the map and ROUND DOWN to the hundredth place (0.01) of the quotient.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Add 2) to 1[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tech Known by Civilizations modifier[\BOLD] = 1 + RDDW (0.30 * [BOLD]# known Civs who have the tech[\BOLD] / [BOLD]# of Civs who started the game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Prerequisites modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Start with 1. If the technology does NOT have a minimum requirement (i.e., the starting techs = Fishing, The Wheel, Agriculture, Hunting, Mysticism, Mining), then use 1 AS the modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Add 0.2 to 1) if a Technology has a MINIMUM Requirement that the player has met. Note: Even if a tech has MANY MANDATORY PREREQUISITES, it will still only give you a boost of 1.2 because you MUST have all those prerequisites to research the tech.

If you also had [BOLD]Currency[\BOLD], then the modifier would be 1.4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Overflow[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The overflow is calculated by the modifiers from the PREVIOUS Technology. Therefore, if you finished researching [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] this turn, and you had all THREE optional requirements, the overflow beakers which applied to your next technology would be equal to however many you had left USING THE MODIFIERS FOR [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] after finishing [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD]. So, your Requirements modifier would be 1.6 (1.2 * 3). So, you could conceivable get a significant boost toward your next tech OVER WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN if you have a lot of overflow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Repercussions[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) It can be VERY important to establish contact with all the other civilizations in order to speed your beakers applied count. You could potentially be making 28% (17 known civs w/ tech/ 18 civs total) more beakers than you normally could on a tech. This is especially true on harder difficulties. If you just meet half of the other civs, your research on techs known by the others would improve by 14%. This is probably the biggest repercussion of the calculation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) If you're going to research several technologies and one is an optional requirement of another, research the optional one first as that will boost your research toward the other one [BOLD]unless you have a specific reason for researching the other one[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) If you're researching the starting techs (no prerequisites modifier), try to reduce the amount of overflow you have, as you're multiplying it by the lowest amount possible. It would be better spent earning some gold which may be necessary to run a deficit research job.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) If you're researching a tech which is known by a lot of people and which has many optional prerequisites which you already have, try to time it so that you end a turn with 1 beaker left to research that tech. The next turn INCREASE the amount of commerce you generate in order to increase the research overflow on the next turn to the max amount possible. You could potentially generate 104.8% ((1 + 17 known civs w/ tech/18 civs) * 1.6 [tech w/ 3 optional prerequisites]) more beakers of overflow than you normally would for that tech (assuming it's from Writing to a Starting Tech which no one knows. I know, it's unlikely.). However, for a realistic overflow difference getting almost 46% (1.25 * 1.4 / 1.2) more beakers in overflow is very feasible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][First tech = 6 known civs w/ tech out of 7 civs and 1 additional optional prerequisite obtained][NEWLINE][Second tech = no known civs with tech and no additional optional prerequisites obtained][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]like Paper w/ Civil Service and Theology to Education.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Pre-Alphabet (and possibly in non-tech trading games), you will be able to determine the number of known players with a certain tech but not who has this specific tech unless all known or no known civs have it.

		<Italian>[H1]Technology Research Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Requies[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Research. It's the fundamental way of advancing in life and in Civ IV, and a necessary part of making your way up the food chain in Civ IV from doormat to winner (whether via space race, diplomacy, conquest, or culture). Unfortunately, it's also the way to figure out how research actually works in Civ IV.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately for you all, I've done all that. This article came about because I was interested in what the optimal start to the game was. However, upon working out that information, I was startled to discover that the amount of research differed from what my lone city was producing. I dug further in depth into the mechanisms of the game and figured out how research is priced, accumulated, and applied in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This article will explain the ins and outs of how your beakers get put to work to research the technologies that make or break your game of Civ. To learn more, read on....[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]One important note.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR means rounding DOWN to the nearest integer AND it has higher precedence than all other operators EXCEPT FOR parentheses. You will see it used a lot in the article.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The basics (of generating beakers)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Each city generates a raw amount of commerce via the squares that are being worked and the trade routes in the cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) This commerce is in turn translated into beakers (research), coins (gold), or notes (culture) via the technology and culture sliders. The actual amount of beakers and notes are gained by using the specified slider rate in the following equation:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]FLOOR (total commerce * the specified slider rate).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The remainder is then given in gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So, yes, you WILL get AT LEAST one gold from each city that has a commerce that is not a multiple of 10, if your science or culture is not 100%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Each city then takes each amount and adds in any additional sources of research, gold, or culture (via shrines, production processes, and specialists, mainly).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Each city then multiplies it by whatever modifiers it has depending on what buildings it has built (e.g., beakers are multiplied by 1.25 if it has a library, gold is multiplied by 1.5 if it has a bank, etc.). NOTE: multipliers are ADDITIVE (i.e., if you have a library and university, your beakers will be multiplied by 1.5 (1 + 0.25 + 0.25) NOT 1.5625 (1 * 1.25 * 1.25)).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) The beaker totals are then added up across the cities and the sum is your base beaker total.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Technology Costs[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To calculate the technology cost of a technology:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Take the base cost of the technology. (This can be found for each technology in Assets\XML\Technologies\CIV4TechInfo.xml).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Take the Difficulty Modifier and add 0.5 * the Number of teammates you have to it. (The difficulty modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4HandicapInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Multiply 1) by 2) and take the FLOOR of the product.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Multiply 3) by the Map Modifier and take the FLOOR of the product.

This generates the actual cost of the technology. (The speed modifier can be found in Assets\XML\GameInfo\CIV4GameSpeedInfo.xml.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thus the formula to calculate a Technology's cost is:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Technology Cost[\BOLD] = FLOOR (FLOOR (FLOOR ([BOLD]Base Cost[\BOLD] * ([BOLD]Difficulty Modifier[\BOLD] + 0.5 * [BOLD]# of teammates[\BOLD])) * [BOLD]Map Modifier[\BOLD]) * [BOLD]Speed Modifier[\BOLD])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Applying the Research to the Technology[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The amount of beakers applied to the technology cost is dependant upon the number of civilizations which know the tech and the number of requirements you have fulfilled for the technology.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Known Civilizations w/ Tech modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Multiply 0.30 by the number of KNOWN, [BOLD]LIVING[\BOLD] civilizations, who have the tech.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Divide by the number of civilizations which STARTED on the map and ROUND DOWN to the hundredth place (0.01) of the quotient.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Add 2) to 1[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tech Known by Civilizations modifier[\BOLD] = 1 + RDDW (0.30 * [BOLD]# known Civs who have the tech[\BOLD] / [BOLD]# of Civs who started the game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Calculating the Prerequisites modifier[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Start with 1. If the technology does NOT have a minimum requirement (i.e., the starting techs = Fishing, The Wheel, Agriculture, Hunting, Mysticism, Mining), then use 1 AS the modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Add 0.2 to 1) if a Technology has a MINIMUM Requirement that the player has met. Note: Even if a tech has MANY MANDATORY PREREQUISITES, it will still only give you a boost of 1.2 because you MUST have all those prerequisites to research the tech.

If you also had [BOLD]Currency[\BOLD], then the modifier would be 1.4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Overflow[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The overflow is calculated by the modifiers from the PREVIOUS Technology. Therefore, if you finished researching [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] this turn, and you had all THREE optional requirements, the overflow beakers which applied to your next technology would be equal to however many you had left USING THE MODIFIERS FOR [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD] after finishing [BOLD]Writing[\BOLD]. So, your Requirements modifier would be 1.6 (1.2 * 3). So, you could conceivable get a significant boost toward your next tech OVER WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN if you have a lot of overflow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Repercussions[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) It can be VERY important to establish contact with all the other civilizations in order to speed your beakers applied count. You could potentially be making 28% (17 known civs w/ tech/ 18 civs total) more beakers than you normally could on a tech. This is especially true on harder difficulties. If you just meet half of the other civs, your research on techs known by the others would improve by 14%. This is probably the biggest repercussion of the calculation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) If you're going to research several technologies and one is an optional requirement of another, research the optional one first as that will boost your research toward the other one [BOLD]unless you have a specific reason for researching the other one[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) If you're researching the starting techs (no prerequisites modifier), try to reduce the amount of overflow you have, as you're multiplying it by the lowest amount possible. It would be better spent earning some gold which may be necessary to run a deficit research job.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) If you're researching a tech which is known by a lot of people and which has many optional prerequisites which you already have, try to time it so that you end a turn with 1 beaker left to research that tech. The next turn INCREASE the amount of commerce you generate in order to increase the research overflow on the next turn to the max amount possible. You could potentially generate 104.8% ((1 + 17 known civs w/ tech/18 civs) * 1.6 [tech w/ 3 optional prerequisites]) more beakers of overflow than you normally would for that tech (assuming it's from Writing to a Starting Tech which no one knows. I know, it's unlikely.). However, for a realistic overflow difference getting almost 46% (1.25 * 1.4 / 1.2) more beakers in overflow is very feasible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][First tech = 6 known civs w/ tech out of 7 civs and 1 additional optional prerequisite obtained][NEWLINE][Second tech = no known civs with tech and no additional optional prerequisites obtained][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]like Paper w/ Civil Service and Theology to Education.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Pre-Alphabet (and possibly in non-tech trading games), you will be able to determine the number of known players with a certain tech but not who has this specific tech unless all known or no known civs have it.

		<English>[H1]The Inner Workings of the Demographics Screen Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Robi D[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have noticed that there has been a fair amount of argument about the Demographics screen, both with how they get the numbers and what they mean. So I decided to do a little digging through the code and do some experiments to see how it all worked to see if the Demographics can be of any use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]This has been updated for Beyond the Sword 3.02, Warlord 2.13 and Vanilla 1.74.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]For sections that are the same for both Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13 and BTS 3.02 there will be no notation. For sections where there are differences there will be a notation whether it's for Vanilla 1.74, Warlords 2.13 or BTS 3.02.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]1. Graphs[\H2][NEWLINE]There are 6 graphs that are displayed.[NEWLINE][BOLD]Game Score[\BOLD]' The accumulated score on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- The GNP produced on each turn (this takes in account all the improvements)[NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods[\BOLD]- The Mfg. Goods produced on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Crop Yield produced on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Power[\BOLD]- The amount of Soldiers on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Culture[\BOLD]- The total culture of all your cities on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS only)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Espionage[\BOLD]- The total amount of Espionage Points produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: In BTS rival graphs only become visible after you have the required amount of EP's against that rival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]2. Demographics Screen[\H2][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The GNP (Gross National Product) is the total of the raw commerce you produce on each turn minus your expenses (city, civic, unit maintenance etc.) Your raw commerce is the gold coins you get from all your worked tiles, the palace, specialists and trade routes. It does not include commerce gained from holy cities and city improvements like markets and banks. When you look at the F2 screen it shows your commerce and income after all the improvements. The commerce figure (left column) also has science commerce which includes the effects of universities etc. However on the F1 screen in the coins column it shows the raw commerce value each city is producing, add these up and subtract you cost and you will get your GNP figure. Therefore it is entirely possible to have a negative GNP but run a profit and continue research at a good pace.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]In BTS the GNP is not just about the commerce. The GNP also includes the beakers, culture and espionage points produced in each turn. All these are calculated with the effects of improvements taken into account. Therefore the GNP calculation is;[NEWLINE]Total commerce + total culture + total espionage + (total research * research bonus) ' expenses.[NEWLINE]The research bonus is what you get from knowing the prerequisite and other nations you have met who know the tech you are researching, so your GNP can increase by your neighbour discovering the tech you're currently researching. If you look at the F2 screen it gives you the totals in the left hand column and the expenses in the right column, however the research figure doesn't take into account the research bonus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods[\BOLD]- The Manufactured Goods is the total of the production you produce on each turn. The raw production is the total hammers you get from each worked tile and specialists, however unlike commerce this does include the effects from city improvements like forges and factories etc. The hammer column on the F1 screen reflects this number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Crop Yield[\BOLD]- Crop Yield is the total amount of food you produce each turn from your worked tiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- This has been the most intensive and by far the longest to research, as there are many factors that contribute to this number. Firstly it has no bearing on the total units you have in fact you could have zero units but show 100000+ soldiers in the demo screen, you will see how in a second.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 1[\BOLD]- Population points. For every two population points from all your cities you get 1000 soldiers. So;[NEWLINE]1pop = 0 soldiers[NEWLINE]2pop= 1000[NEWLINE]3pop= 1000[NEWLINE]4pop= 2000[NEWLINE]5pop= 2000[NEWLINE]6pop= 3000 and so on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 2[\BOLD]- Technologies. Discovering some technologies (mostly military but not exclusively) gives you extra soldiers. I have to say some of them struck me as a little strange, like Military tradition gives you zero but hunting gives you 2000, but I'm not here to argue about that. Here is the list of techs that give you soldiers. If they are not listed then they give zero soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers- Composites, Stealth[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry, Advanced Flight, Laser[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling, Military Science[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in brief- Composites goes from 0 to 5000 and new BTS techs Laser, Stealth, Advanced Flight and Military Science [\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 3[\BOLD]- City Improvement/Wonders. Like discovering some technologies, build certain improvements and wonders will increase the amount of soldiers you have on the demo screen. In this case you amount added for each improvement. For example you get 2000 soldiers for each wall you build, so if you have 5 walls, you have an extra 10000 soldiers. With wonders that give you soldiers, you can only build one so you only get that bonus once. Here is the list of what you get for each improvement. Improvements that don't give soldiers are not listed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers- Walls, Castles, Dry dock, Forge, Factory[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Barracks, Mt.

No changes to existing building between Warlords and BTS. Warlords and BTS add new buildings.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 4[\BOLD]- Units. Finally each unit type has a different amount of soldiers attached to it, so a warrior contributes 1000 soldiers, while a Swordsman is 3000 soldiers. Interestingly enough a units experience points has no bearing on the amount of soldiers it equates to. Units such as scouts, workers missionaries and spies contribute zero soldiers to the demo screen. Here is the full list of what you get for each unit;[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Axeman, Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Swordsman, Phalanx, Skimisher, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Caravel[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Jaguar Warrior, Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, War Elephant, Galleon[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport,[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Conquistador, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][BOLD](For Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Axeman, Swordsman, Jaguar Warrior, Gallic Warrior, Phalanx, Skimisher, Impi, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Trireme, Caravel[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, War Elephant, Galleon, Numidian Cavalry, Hwacha, Trebuchet[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport[NEWLINE]7000 soldiers - Berserker[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Conquistador, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine, Janissary[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley, Airship[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Axeman, Swordsman, Jaguar Warrior, Gallic Warrior, Phalanx, Impi, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Trireme, Caravel, Holkan, Carrack[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, Galleon, Numidian Cavalry, Hwacha, Trebuchet, Skrimisher, Vulture, Dog Soldier, Bowman, Privateer[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman, War Elephant, Landsknecht, East Indiaman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport, Ballista Elephant, Ship of the Line[NEWLINE]7000 soldiers - Berserker[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine, Janissary, Oromo Warrior, Attack Submarine, Cataphract[NEWLINE]9000 soldiers - Cuirassier[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier, Conquistador, Stealth Destroyer, Guided Missile[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]14000 soldiers ' Missile Cruiser[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry, Anti Tank[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine, Paratrooper[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry, Mobile SAM, Tactical Nuke[NEWLINE]32000 soldiers ' Mobile Artillery[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in Brief ' Between Vanilla and Warlords, Axeman go from 2000 to 3000 and Jaguar Warrior go from 4000 to 3000. Between Warlords and BTS, Skrimisher go from 3000 to 4000, War Elephant go from 4000 to 5000 and Conquistador go from 8000 to 10000. Warlords and BTS add new units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Land Area[\BOLD]- The total number of land squares within your borders * 1000. Coast and Ocean tiles are not counted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Population[\BOLD]- The population of all your cities. You can see in the city screen when you run the mouse cursor over the city name. For example a city with 1 pop point = 1000 people, with 2 pop points = 6000, 3 pop points = 21000. All these population scores are added up to give you the result.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate[\BOLD]- Is the percentage of happy faces your cities generate divided by the total number of happy and unhappy faces produced. The formula is happy / happy + unhappy. At the beginning of the game when there are no happy or unhappy faces the game defaults to a rating is 50%. You can see the total of unhappy and happy faces for each city in the f1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD] Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- Works on the same principle as the approval rate except it deals with health and sickness. The formula is health / health + sickness. At the beginning of the game the default is 30 years. You can see the total for health and sickness of each city in the F1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- The amount of commerce you get from trade routes to your cities is the Imports, the total amount of commerce other nations cities get from your cities is the Exports. In effect its counter intuitive, since you would expect that the money you get from other cities is from your Exports and the money other cities get is from your Imports, however it works the other way around, again this does seem strange but as I said before I'm not here to argue about it. Trade routes between cities in your nation are not counted. The Imports/Export are ranked by formula using the imports divided by the exports to get a ratio. If either or both are zero then it is treated as 1. That's why you see a nation with a Imp/Exp ratio of 12/2 ranked better than a nation with a ratio of 155/35, because the ratio of Imports to Exports is higher (6 compared to 4.4). Personally I'd take the second one any day of the week because I would be getting a lot more money out of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that all of these figures are NOT standardized to the difficulty level, so if you're playing against the AI at Deity and you have equal production, then the AI is building its units and city improvements faster than you since the AI only need 2/3 of the hammers to make something. The opposite applies for lower levels where the AI gets a production penalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. So what does it all mean?[\H2][NEWLINE]Each figure on its own does tell you much at all as to how you empire is going compared to everyone else, but if you look at them all together you can get a pretty good picture of what's going on and use it to your advantage. Obviously the stats alone wont tell you exactly what's happening with your rivals nor should they, but they can give you a rough idea of what's happening in their nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla and Warlords)[\BOLD] The GNP may seem useless, especially when you see you have a negative GNP but are still doing well. The GNP by itself doesn't say how well your economy is going, however it does show how vulnerable an economy is to sabotage. If the GNP is low or negative then someone pillaging some towns or taking a key economic city can send the economic structure into ruins very quickly. Therefore if you see a nation that a low GNP compared to food and production, even if they are big and powerful a short concentrated campaign on the financial infrastructure could bring them to their knees.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS)[\BOLD] With BTS the GNP takes on a different meaning. In fact it becomes an indicator to the overall prosperity of a nation rather than just an indication of how much commerce tiles are being worked. This makes it more useful in judging how well a nation is off, because to get a high GNP you need to have improvement in all areas to generating extra commerce, research, culture and espionage. However since the research bonus is added into the figure it is more sensitive to changes in research level then the other three. The only problem with it measuring 4 factors instead of 1 is that you don't know the proportion of the contribution of each to the value, but i guess that is what your spies are for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods and Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Food Yield and Production can be very useful early on in the game when there is only a few cities, because it can clearly show whether an opponent is concentrating on building military units or population growth. This can be very useful in fast paced Multiplayer games as it lets you anticipate an imminent attack from an opponent near by. Even later in the game you can see these trends will show up, however they are less noticeable. One thing is will give you a good idea of later in the game is what the land of different nations might be like without being able to see it, by comparing the output levels to other nations. A nation ranked high in Goods by low in Food probably has a lot of hills in its territory, if Food is high and Goods are low then there a good chance a lot of the territory is grassland and flood plains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate and Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- The approval rate and life expectance show you the potential nations have for future population growth in their cites, as high numbers in both these categories means that there is plenty of room to added pop points to cities without having unhappy or unhealthy people. This is especially true in the early part of the game. Numbers around 50% mean they have reached the limit, while numbers below 50% show that they have overstretched their resources and could be vulnerable. Also if you look at the at the food yield along with the happiness and healthiness of a nation and find all three are high, especially in the later part of the game then it's a good bet they are focusing on having specialists in their cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- The Soldiers/Power can be a little deceptive when gauging an opponent as its not based entirely on the units. It seems to be a combination of actual power and potential power put together, so you have to do a bit of investigating as to why an opponent is rated as powerful as they are, because it could be mainly from techs and city improvement or it could be mainly from lots of older units, or from a few modern ones, or it could be from an even combination of all of them. This can be very difficult to read in the early part of the game as one change can make a big difference. The best way to find out is getting an open borders agreement and poking around a bit, from there you can see how there power stacks up to your and if you can win. This can be used to your advantage, because a rival could suddenly jump up in the power stakes, but not have the units yet, in this case a quick strike can stop them becoming a headache in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- This one is not very important when it comes to measuring the strength or prosperity of a nation but it still gives you some useful information, because to have trade routes, you need to have open border agreements with other nations, and therefore how many potential friends they may have in future conflicts. This is nullified when the UN resolution for open trade is passed because trade takes place in if borders are closed. The ratio of Imports to Exports gives you an idea of how much a nation has invested in infrastructure like harbours etc. which give trade bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All in all the demographics screen can be a very useful tool when you understand how it works and the information it provides. When you look at all the different areas as a whole you can get picture of a nation's strengths and weakness, all of which can be used to your advantage. I hope all that I have found can be useful to everyone in their future civving endeavours.</English>

Warlords and BTS add new units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Land Area[\BOLD]- The total number of land squares within your borders * 1000. Coast and Ocean tiles are not counted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Population[\BOLD]- The population of all your cities. You can see in the city screen when you run the mouse cursor over the city name. For example a city with 1 pop point = 1000 people, with 2 pop points = 6000, 3 pop points = 21000. All these population scores are added up to give you the result.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate[\BOLD]- Is the percentage of happy faces your cities generate divided by the total number of happy and unhappy faces produced. The formula is happy / happy + unhappy. At the beginning of the game when there are no happy or unhappy faces the game defaults to a rating is 50%. You can see the total of unhappy and happy faces for each city in the f1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD] Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- Works on the same principle as the approval rate except it deals with health and sickness. The formula is health / health + sickness. At the beginning of the game the default is 30 years. You can see the total for health and sickness of each city in the F1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- The amount of commerce you get from trade routes to your cities is the Imports, the total amount of commerce other nations cities get from your cities is the Exports. In effect its counter intuitive, since you would expect that the money you get from other cities is from your Exports and the money other cities get is from your Imports, however it works the other way around, again this does seem strange but as I said before I'm not here to argue about it. Trade routes between cities in your nation are not counted. The Imports/Export are ranked by formula using the imports divided by the exports to get a ratio. If either or both are zero then it is treated as 1. That's why you see a nation with a Imp/Exp ratio of 12/2 ranked better than a nation with a ratio of 155/35, because the ratio of Imports to Exports is higher (6 compared to 4.4). Personally I'd take the second one any day of the week because I would be getting a lot more money out of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that all of these figures are NOT standardized to the difficulty level, so if you're playing against the AI at Deity and you have equal production, then the AI is building its units and city improvements faster than you since the AI only need 2/3 of the hammers to make something. The opposite applies for lower levels where the AI gets a production penalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. So what does it all mean?[\H2][NEWLINE]Each figure on its own does tell you much at all as to how you empire is going compared to everyone else, but if you look at them all together you can get a pretty good picture of what's going on and use it to your advantage. Obviously the stats alone wont tell you exactly what's happening with your rivals nor should they, but they can give you a rough idea of what's happening in their nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla and Warlords)[\BOLD] The GNP may seem useless, especially when you see you have a negative GNP but are still doing well. The GNP by itself doesn't say how well your economy is going, however it does show how vulnerable an economy is to sabotage. If the GNP is low or negative then someone pillaging some towns or taking a key economic city can send the economic structure into ruins very quickly. Therefore if you see a nation that a low GNP compared to food and production, even if they are big and powerful a short concentrated campaign on the financial infrastructure could bring them to their knees.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS)[\BOLD] With BTS the GNP takes on a different meaning. In fact it becomes an indicator to the overall prosperity of a nation rather than just an indication of how much commerce tiles are being worked. This makes it more useful in judging how well a nation is off, because to get a high GNP you need to have improvement in all areas to generating extra commerce, research, culture and espionage. However since the research bonus is added into the figure it is more sensitive to changes in research level then the other three. The only problem with it measuring 4 factors instead of 1 is that you don't know the proportion of the contribution of each to the value, but i guess that is what your spies are for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods and Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Food Yield and Production can be very useful early on in the game when there is only a few cities, because it can clearly show whether an opponent is concentrating on building military units or population growth. This can be very useful in fast paced Multiplayer games as it lets you anticipate an imminent attack from an opponent near by. Even later in the game you can see these trends will show up, however they are less noticeable. One thing is will give you a good idea of later in the game is what the land of different nations might be like without being able to see it, by comparing the output levels to other nations. A nation ranked high in Goods by low in Food probably has a lot of hills in its territory, if Food is high and Goods are low then there a good chance a lot of the territory is grassland and flood plains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate and Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- The approval rate and life expectance show you the potential nations have for future population growth in their cites, as high numbers in both these categories means that there is plenty of room to added pop points to cities without having unhappy or unhealthy people. This is especially true in the early part of the game. Numbers around 50% mean they have reached the limit, while numbers below 50% show that they have overstretched their resources and could be vulnerable. Also if you look at the at the food yield along with the happiness and healthiness of a nation and find all three are high, especially in the later part of the game then it's a good bet they are focusing on having specialists in their cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- The Soldiers/Power can be a little deceptive when gauging an opponent as its not based entirely on the units. It seems to be a combination of actual power and potential power put together, so you have to do a bit of investigating as to why an opponent is rated as powerful as they are, because it could be mainly from techs and city improvement or it could be mainly from lots of older units, or from a few modern ones, or it could be from an even combination of all of them. This can be very difficult to read in the early part of the game as one change can make a big difference. The best way to find out is getting an open borders agreement and poking around a bit, from there you can see how there power stacks up to your and if you can win. This can be used to your advantage, because a rival could suddenly jump up in the power stakes, but not have the units yet, in this case a quick strike can stop them becoming a headache in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- This one is not very important when it comes to measuring the strength or prosperity of a nation but it still gives you some useful information, because to have trade routes, you need to have open border agreements with other nations, and therefore how many potential friends they may have in future conflicts. This is nullified when the UN resolution for open trade is passed because trade takes place in if borders are closed. The ratio of Imports to Exports gives you an idea of how much a nation has invested in infrastructure like harbours etc. which give trade bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All in all the demographics screen can be a very useful tool when you understand how it works and the information it provides. When you look at all the different areas as a whole you can get picture of a nation's strengths and weakness, all of which can be used to your advantage. I hope all that I have found can be useful to everyone in their future civving endeavours.</French>
		<German>[H1]The Inner Workings of the Demographics Screen Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Robi D[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have noticed that there has been a fair amount of argument about the Demographics screen, both with how they get the numbers and what they mean. So I decided to do a little digging through the code and do some experiments to see how it all worked to see if the Demographics can be of any use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]This has been updated for Beyond the Sword 3.02, Warlord 2.13 and Vanilla 1.74.[\BOLD][NEWLINE]For sections that are the same for both Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13 and BTS 3.02 there will be no notation. For sections where there are differences there will be a notation whether it's for Vanilla 1.74, Warlords 2.13 or BTS 3.02.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]1. Graphs[\H2][NEWLINE]There are 6 graphs that are displayed.[NEWLINE][BOLD]Game Score[\BOLD]' The accumulated score on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- The GNP produced on each turn (this takes in account all the improvements)[NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods[\BOLD]- The Mfg. Goods produced on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Crop Yield produced on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Power[\BOLD]- The amount of Soldiers on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]Culture[\BOLD]- The total culture of all your cities on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS only)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Espionage[\BOLD]- The total amount of Espionage Points produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: In BTS rival graphs only become visible after you have the required amount of EP's against that rival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]2. Demographics Screen[\H2][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The GNP (Gross National Product) is the total of the raw commerce you produce on each turn minus your expenses (city, civic, unit maintenance etc.) Your raw commerce is the gold coins you get from all your worked tiles, the palace, specialists and trade routes. It does not include commerce gained from holy cities and city improvements like markets and banks. When you look at the F2 screen it shows your commerce and income after all the improvements. The commerce figure (left column) also has science commerce which includes the effects of universities etc. However on the F1 screen in the coins column it shows the raw commerce value each city is producing, add these up and subtract you cost and you will get your GNP figure. Therefore it is entirely possible to have a negative GNP but run a profit and continue research at a good pace.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]In BTS the GNP is not just about the commerce. The GNP also includes the beakers, culture and espionage points produced in each turn. All these are calculated with the effects of improvements taken into account. Therefore the GNP calculation is;[NEWLINE]Total commerce + total culture + total espionage + (total research * research bonus) ' expenses.[NEWLINE]The research bonus is what you get from knowing the prerequisite and other nations you have met who know the tech you are researching, so your GNP can increase by your neighbour discovering the tech you're currently researching. If you look at the F2 screen it gives you the totals in the left hand column and the expenses in the right column, however the research figure doesn't take into account the research bonus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods[\BOLD]- The Manufactured Goods is the total of the production you produce on each turn. The raw production is the total hammers you get from each worked tile and specialists, however unlike commerce this does include the effects from city improvements like forges and factories etc. The hammer column on the F1 screen reflects this number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Crop Yield[\BOLD]- Crop Yield is the total amount of food you produce each turn from your worked tiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- This has been the most intensive and by far the longest to research, as there are many factors that contribute to this number. Firstly it has no bearing on the total units you have in fact you could have zero units but show 100000+ soldiers in the demo screen, you will see how in a second.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 1[\BOLD]- Population points. For every two population points from all your cities you get 1000 soldiers. So;[NEWLINE]1pop = 0 soldiers[NEWLINE]2pop= 1000[NEWLINE]3pop= 1000[NEWLINE]4pop= 2000[NEWLINE]5pop= 2000[NEWLINE]6pop= 3000 and so on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 2[\BOLD]- Technologies. Discovering some technologies (mostly military but not exclusively) gives you extra soldiers. I have to say some of them struck me as a little strange, like Military tradition gives you zero but hunting gives you 2000, but I'm not here to argue about that. Here is the list of techs that give you soldiers. If they are not listed then they give zero soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers- Composites, Stealth[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry, Advanced Flight, Laser[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling, Military Science[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in brief- Composites goes from 0 to 5000 and new BTS techs Laser, Stealth, Advanced Flight and Military Science [\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 3[\BOLD]- City Improvement/Wonders. Like discovering some technologies, build certain improvements and wonders will increase the amount of soldiers you have on the demo screen. In this case you amount added for each improvement. For example you get 2000 soldiers for each wall you build, so if you have 5 walls, you have an extra 10000 soldiers. With wonders that give you soldiers, you can only build one so you only get that bonus once. Here is the list of what you get for each improvement.

So what does it all mean?[\H2][NEWLINE]Each figure on its own does tell you much at all as to how you empire is going compared to everyone else, but if you look at them all together you can get a pretty good picture of what's going on and use it to your advantage. Obviously the stats alone wont tell you exactly what's happening with your rivals nor should they, but they can give you a rough idea of what's happening in their nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla and Warlords)[\BOLD] The GNP may seem useless, especially when you see you have a negative GNP but are still doing well. The GNP by itself doesn't say how well your economy is going, however it does show how vulnerable an economy is to sabotage. If the GNP is low or negative then someone pillaging some towns or taking a key economic city can send the economic structure into ruins very quickly. Therefore if you see a nation that a low GNP compared to food and production, even if they are big and powerful a short concentrated campaign on the financial infrastructure could bring them to their knees.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS)[\BOLD] With BTS the GNP takes on a different meaning. In fact it becomes an indicator to the overall prosperity of a nation rather than just an indication of how much commerce tiles are being worked. This makes it more useful in judging how well a nation is off, because to get a high GNP you need to have improvement in all areas to generating extra commerce, research, culture and espionage. However since the research bonus is added into the figure it is more sensitive to changes in research level then the other three. The only problem with it measuring 4 factors instead of 1 is that you don't know the proportion of the contribution of each to the value, but i guess that is what your spies are for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods and Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Food Yield and Production can be very useful early on in the game when there is only a few cities, because it can clearly show whether an opponent is concentrating on building military units or population growth. This can be very useful in fast paced Multiplayer games as it lets you anticipate an imminent attack from an opponent near by. Even later in the game you can see these trends will show up, however they are less noticeable. One thing is will give you a good idea of later in the game is what the land of different nations might be like without being able to see it, by comparing the output levels to other nations. A nation ranked high in Goods by low in Food probably has a lot of hills in its territory, if Food is high and Goods are low then there a good chance a lot of the territory is grassland and flood plains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate and Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- The approval rate and life expectance show you the potential nations have for future population growth in their cites, as high numbers in both these categories means that there is plenty of room to added pop points to cities without having unhappy or unhealthy people. This is especially true in the early part of the game. Numbers around 50% mean they have reached the limit, while numbers below 50% show that they have overstretched their resources and could be vulnerable. Also if you look at the at the food yield along with the happiness and healthiness of a nation and find all three are high, especially in the later part of the game then it's a good bet they are focusing on having specialists in their cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- The Soldiers/Power can be a little deceptive when gauging an opponent as its not based entirely on the units. It seems to be a combination of actual power and potential power put together, so you have to do a bit of investigating as to why an opponent is rated as powerful as they are, because it could be mainly from techs and city improvement or it could be mainly from lots of older units, or from a few modern ones, or it could be from an even combination of all of them. This can be very difficult to read in the early part of the game as one change can make a big difference. The best way to find out is getting an open borders agreement and poking around a bit, from there you can see how there power stacks up to your and if you can win. This can be used to your advantage, because a rival could suddenly jump up in the power stakes, but not have the units yet, in this case a quick strike can stop them becoming a headache in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- This one is not very important when it comes to measuring the strength or prosperity of a nation but it still gives you some useful information, because to have trade routes, you need to have open border agreements with other nations, and therefore how many potential friends they may have in future conflicts. This is nullified when the UN resolution for open trade is passed because trade takes place in if borders are closed. The ratio of Imports to Exports gives you an idea of how much a nation has invested in infrastructure like harbours etc. which give trade bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All in all the demographics screen can be a very useful tool when you understand how it works and the information it provides. When you look at all the different areas as a whole you can get picture of a nation's strengths and weakness, all of which can be used to your advantage. I hope all that I have found can be useful to everyone in their future civving endeavours.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]The Inner Workings of the Demographics Screen Explained[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Robi D[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have noticed that there has been a fair amount of argument about the Demographics screen, both with how they get the numbers and what they mean.

For sections where there are differences there will be a notation whether it's for Vanilla 1.74, Warlords 2.13 or BTS 3.02.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]1. Graphs[\H2][NEWLINE]There are 6 graphs that are displayed.[NEWLINE][BOLD]Game Score[\BOLD]' The accumulated score on each turn[NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- The GNP produced on each turn (this takes in account all the improvements)[NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg.

Demographics Screen[\H2][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]The GNP (Gross National Product) is the total of the raw commerce you produce on each turn minus your expenses (city, civic, unit maintenance etc.) Your raw commerce is the gold coins you get from all your worked tiles, the palace, specialists and trade routes. It does not include commerce gained from holy cities and city improvements like markets and banks. When you look at the F2 screen it shows your commerce and income after all the improvements. The commerce figure (left column) also has science commerce which includes the effects of universities etc. However on the F1 screen in the coins column it shows the raw commerce value each city is producing, add these up and subtract you cost and you will get your GNP figure. Therefore it is entirely possible to have a negative GNP but run a profit and continue research at a good pace.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]In BTS the GNP is not just about the commerce. The GNP also includes the beakers, culture and espionage points produced in each turn. All these are calculated with the effects of improvements taken into account. Therefore the GNP calculation is;[NEWLINE]Total commerce + total culture + total espionage + (total research * research bonus) ' expenses.[NEWLINE]The research bonus is what you get from knowing the prerequisite and other nations you have met who know the tech you are researching, so your GNP can increase by your neighbour discovering the tech you're currently researching. If you look at the F2 screen it gives you the totals in the left hand column and the expenses in the right column, however the research figure doesn't take into account the research bonus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods[\BOLD]- The Manufactured Goods is the total of the production you produce on each turn. The raw production is the total hammers you get from each worked tile and specialists, however unlike commerce this does include the effects from city improvements like forges and factories etc. The hammer column on the F1 screen reflects this number.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Crop Yield[\BOLD]- Crop Yield is the total amount of food you produce each turn from your worked tiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- This has been the most intensive and by far the longest to research, as there are many factors that contribute to this number. Firstly it has no bearing on the total units you have in fact you could have zero units but show 100000+ soldiers in the demo screen, you will see how in a second.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 1[\BOLD]- Population points. For every two population points from all your cities you get 1000 soldiers. So;[NEWLINE]1pop = 0 soldiers[NEWLINE]2pop= 1000[NEWLINE]3pop= 1000[NEWLINE]4pop= 2000[NEWLINE]5pop= 2000[NEWLINE]6pop= 3000 and so on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 2[\BOLD]- Technologies. Discovering some technologies (mostly military but not exclusively) gives you extra soldiers. I have to say some of them struck me as a little strange, like Military tradition gives you zero but hunting gives you 2000, but I'm not here to argue about that. Here is the list of techs that give you soldiers. If they are not listed then they give zero soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers- Composites, Stealth[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry, Advanced Flight, Laser[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling, Military Science[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in brief- Composites goes from 0 to 5000 and new BTS techs Laser, Stealth, Advanced Flight and Military Science [\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 3[\BOLD]- City Improvement/Wonders. Like discovering some technologies, build certain improvements and wonders will increase the amount of soldiers you have on the demo screen. In this case you amount added for each improvement. For example you get 2000 soldiers for each wall you build, so if you have 5 walls, you have an extra 10000 soldiers. With wonders that give you soldiers, you can only build one so you only get that bonus once. Here is the list of what you get for each improvement. Improvements that don't give soldiers are not listed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers- Walls, Castles, Dry dock, Forge, Factory[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Barracks, Mt.

No changes to existing building between Warlords and BTS. Warlords and BTS add new buildings.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 4[\BOLD]- Units. Finally each unit type has a different amount of soldiers attached to it, so a warrior contributes 1000 soldiers, while a Swordsman is 3000 soldiers. Interestingly enough a units experience points has no bearing on the amount of soldiers it equates to. Units such as scouts, workers missionaries and spies contribute zero soldiers to the demo screen. Here is the full list of what you get for each unit;[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Axeman, Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Swordsman, Phalanx, Skimisher, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Caravel[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Jaguar Warrior, Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, War Elephant, Galleon[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport,[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Conquistador, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][BOLD](For Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Axeman, Swordsman, Jaguar Warrior, Gallic Warrior, Phalanx, Skimisher, Impi, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Trireme, Caravel[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, War Elephant, Galleon, Numidian Cavalry, Hwacha, Trebuchet[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport[NEWLINE]7000 soldiers - Berserker[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Conquistador, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine, Janissary[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]1000 soldiers ' Warrior, Quechua[NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Spearman, Archer, Chariot, Galley, Airship[NEWLINE]3000 soldiers ' Axeman, Swordsman, Jaguar Warrior, Gallic Warrior, Phalanx, Impi, War Chariot, Immortal, Horse Archer, Catapult, Trireme, Caravel, Holkan, Carrack[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers ' Praetorian, Pikeman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Keshik, Galleon, Numidian Cavalry, Hwacha, Trebuchet, Skrimisher, Vulture, Dog Soldier, Bowman, Privateer[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers ' Cho-Ko-Nu, Maceman, War Elephant, Landsknecht, East Indiaman[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers ' Samurai, Musketman, Knight, Frigate, Ironclad, Transport, Ballista Elephant, Ship of the Line[NEWLINE]7000 soldiers - Berserker[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers ' Musketeer, Camel Archer, Cannon, Destroyer, Submarine, Janissary, Oromo Warrior, Attack Submarine, Cataphract[NEWLINE]9000 soldiers - Cuirassier[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers ' Rifleman, Grenadier, Machine Gun, Carrier, Conquistador, Stealth Destroyer, Guided Missile[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers ' Redcoat, Cavalry, Battleship[NEWLINE]14000 soldiers ' Missile Cruiser[NEWLINE]15000 soldiers ' Cossack, Fighter, Jet Fighter, Bomber[NEWLINE]16000 soldiers ' Infantry, Anti Tank[NEWLINE]18000 soldiers ' Marine, Paratrooper[NEWLINE]20000 soldiers ' SAM Infantry, Gunship, Artillery, Stealth Bomber[NEWLINE]22000 soldiers ' Navy SEAL[NEWLINE]25000 soldiers ' Tank[NEWLINE]30000 soldiers ' Panzer, Mechanized Infantry, Mobile SAM, Tactical Nuke[NEWLINE]32000 soldiers ' Mobile Artillery[NEWLINE]40000 soldiers ' Modern Armor, ICBM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in Brief ' Between Vanilla and Warlords, Axeman go from 2000 to 3000 and Jaguar Warrior go from 4000 to 3000. Between Warlords and BTS, Skrimisher go from 3000 to 4000, War Elephant go from 4000 to 5000 and Conquistador go from 8000 to 10000. Warlords and BTS add new units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Land Area[\BOLD]- The total number of land squares within your borders * 1000. Coast and Ocean tiles are not counted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Population[\BOLD]- The population of all your cities. You can see in the city screen when you run the mouse cursor over the city name. For example a city with 1 pop point = 1000 people, with 2 pop points = 6000, 3 pop points = 21000. All these population scores are added up to give you the result.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate[\BOLD]- Is the percentage of happy faces your cities generate divided by the total number of happy and unhappy faces produced. The formula is happy / happy + unhappy. At the beginning of the game when there are no happy or unhappy faces the game defaults to a rating is 50%. You can see the total of unhappy and happy faces for each city in the f1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD] Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- Works on the same principle as the approval rate except it deals with health and sickness. The formula is health / health + sickness. At the beginning of the game the default is 30 years. You can see the total for health and sickness of each city in the F1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- The amount of commerce you get from trade routes to your cities is the Imports, the total amount of commerce other nations cities get from your cities is the Exports. In effect its counter intuitive, since you would expect that the money you get from other cities is from your Exports and the money other cities get is from your Imports, however it works the other way around, again this does seem strange but as I said before I'm not here to argue about it. Trade routes between cities in your nation are not counted. The Imports/Export are ranked by formula using the imports divided by the exports to get a ratio. If either or both are zero then it is treated as 1. That's why you see a nation with a Imp/Exp ratio of 12/2 ranked better than a nation with a ratio of 155/35, because the ratio of Imports to Exports is higher (6 compared to 4.4). Personally I'd take the second one any day of the week because I would be getting a lot more money out of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that all of these figures are NOT standardized to the difficulty level, so if you're playing against the AI at Deity and you have equal production, then the AI is building its units and city improvements faster than you since the AI only need 2/3 of the hammers to make something. The opposite applies for lower levels where the AI gets a production penalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. So what does it all mean?[\H2][NEWLINE]Each figure on its own does tell you much at all as to how you empire is going compared to everyone else, but if you look at them all together you can get a pretty good picture of what's going on and use it to your advantage. Obviously the stats alone wont tell you exactly what's happening with your rivals nor should they, but they can give you a rough idea of what's happening in their nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla and Warlords)[\BOLD] The GNP may seem useless, especially when you see you have a negative GNP but are still doing well. The GNP by itself doesn't say how well your economy is going, however it does show how vulnerable an economy is to sabotage.

If they are not listed then they give zero soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](For Vanilla 1.74 and Warlords 2.13)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling[NEWLINE][BOLD](For BTS 3.02)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]2000 soldiers ' Sailing, Hunting, Mining, Animal Husbandry[NEWLINE]4000 soldiers- Wheel, Alphabet, Astronomy, Metal Casting, Compass, Construction, Steel, Radio, Satellites[NEWLINE]5000 soldiers- Composites, Stealth[NEWLINE]6000 soldiers- Mathematics, Chemistry, Combustion, Archery[NEWLINE]8000 soldiers- Guilds, Fission, Flight, Bronze Working, Machinery, Assembly Line[NEWLINE]10000 soldiers- Horseback Riding, Iron Working, Artillery, Industrialism, Rocketry, Advanced Flight, Laser[NEWLINE]12000 soldiers- Gunpowder, Rifling, Military Science[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Differences in brief- Composites goes from 0 to 5000 and new BTS techs Laser, Stealth, Advanced Flight and Military Science [\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Factor 3[\BOLD]- City Improvement/Wonders. Like discovering some technologies, build certain improvements and wonders will increase the amount of soldiers you have on the demo screen. In this case you amount added for each improvement. For example you get 2000 soldiers for each wall you build, so if you have 5 walls, you have an extra 10000 soldiers. With wonders that give you soldiers, you can only build one so you only get that bonus once. Here is the list of what you get for each improvement.

Finally each unit type has a different amount of soldiers attached to it, so a warrior contributes 1000 soldiers, while a Swordsman is 3000 soldiers. Interestingly enough a units experience points has no bearing on the amount of soldiers it equates to.

Between Warlords and BTS, Skrimisher go from 3000 to 4000, War Elephant go from 4000 to 5000 and Conquistador go from 8000 to 10000. Warlords and BTS add new units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Land Area[\BOLD]- The total number of land squares within your borders * 1000. Coast and Ocean tiles are not counted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Population[\BOLD]- The population of all your cities. You can see in the city screen when you run the mouse cursor over the city name. For example a city with 1 pop point = 1000 people, with 2 pop points = 6000, 3 pop points = 21000. All these population scores are added up to give you the result.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate[\BOLD]- Is the percentage of happy faces your cities generate divided by the total number of happy and unhappy faces produced. The formula is happy / happy + unhappy. At the beginning of the game when there are no happy or unhappy faces the game defaults to a rating is 50%. You can see the total of unhappy and happy faces for each city in the f1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD] Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- Works on the same principle as the approval rate except it deals with health and sickness. The formula is health / health + sickness. At the beginning of the game the default is 30 years. You can see the total for health and sickness of each city in the F1 screen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- The amount of commerce you get from trade routes to your cities is the Imports, the total amount of commerce other nations cities get from your cities is the Exports. In effect its counter intuitive, since you would expect that the money you get from other cities is from your Exports and the money other cities get is from your Imports, however it works the other way around, again this does seem strange but as I said before I'm not here to argue about it. Trade routes between cities in your nation are not counted. The Imports/Export are ranked by formula using the imports divided by the exports to get a ratio. If either or both are zero then it is treated as 1. That's why you see a nation with a Imp/Exp ratio of 12/2 ranked better than a nation with a ratio of 155/35, because the ratio of Imports to Exports is higher (6 compared to 4.4). Personally I'd take the second one any day of the week because I would be getting a lot more money out of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is important to note that all of these figures are NOT standardized to the difficulty level, so if you're playing against the AI at Deity and you have equal production, then the AI is building its units and city improvements faster than you since the AI only need 2/3 of the hammers to make something. The opposite applies for lower levels where the AI gets a production penalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]3. So what does it all mean?[\H2][NEWLINE]Each figure on its own does tell you much at all as to how you empire is going compared to everyone else, but if you look at them all together you can get a pretty good picture of what's going on and use it to your advantage. Obviously the stats alone wont tell you exactly what's happening with your rivals nor should they, but they can give you a rough idea of what's happening in their nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]GNP[\BOLD]- [BOLD](Vanilla and Warlords)[\BOLD] The GNP may seem useless, especially when you see you have a negative GNP but are still doing well. The GNP by itself doesn't say how well your economy is going, however it does show how vulnerable an economy is to sabotage. If the GNP is low or negative then someone pillaging some towns or taking a key economic city can send the economic structure into ruins very quickly. Therefore if you see a nation that a low GNP compared to food and production, even if they are big and powerful a short concentrated campaign on the financial infrastructure could bring them to their knees.[NEWLINE][BOLD](BTS)[\BOLD] With BTS the GNP takes on a different meaning. In fact it becomes an indicator to the overall prosperity of a nation rather than just an indication of how much commerce tiles are being worked. This makes it more useful in judging how well a nation is off, because to get a high GNP you need to have improvement in all areas to generating extra commerce, research, culture and espionage. However since the research bonus is added into the figure it is more sensitive to changes in research level then the other three. The only problem with it measuring 4 factors instead of 1 is that you don't know the proportion of the contribution of each to the value, but i guess that is what your spies are for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mfg. Goods and Crop Yield[\BOLD]- The Food Yield and Production can be very useful early on in the game when there is only a few cities, because it can clearly show whether an opponent is concentrating on building military units or population growth. This can be very useful in fast paced Multiplayer games as it lets you anticipate an imminent attack from an opponent near by. Even later in the game you can see these trends will show up, however they are less noticeable. One thing is will give you a good idea of later in the game is what the land of different nations might be like without being able to see it, by comparing the output levels to other nations. A nation ranked high in Goods by low in Food probably has a lot of hills in its territory, if Food is high and Goods are low then there a good chance a lot of the territory is grassland and flood plains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Approval Rate and Life Expectancy[\BOLD]- The approval rate and life expectance show you the potential nations have for future population growth in their cites, as high numbers in both these categories means that there is plenty of room to added pop points to cities without having unhappy or unhealthy people. This is especially true in the early part of the game. Numbers around 50% mean they have reached the limit, while numbers below 50% show that they have overstretched their resources and could be vulnerable. Also if you look at the at the food yield along with the happiness and healthiness of a nation and find all three are high, especially in the later part of the game then it's a good bet they are focusing on having specialists in their cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Soldiers[\BOLD]- The Soldiers/Power can be a little deceptive when gauging an opponent as its not based entirely on the units. It seems to be a combination of actual power and potential power put together, so you have to do a bit of investigating as to why an opponent is rated as powerful as they are, because it could be mainly from techs and city improvement or it could be mainly from lots of older units, or from a few modern ones, or it could be from an even combination of all of them. This can be very difficult to read in the early part of the game as one change can make a big difference. The best way to find out is getting an open borders agreement and poking around a bit, from there you can see how there power stacks up to your and if you can win. This can be used to your advantage, because a rival could suddenly jump up in the power stakes, but not have the units yet, in this case a quick strike can stop them becoming a headache in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imports/Exports[\BOLD]- This one is not very important when it comes to measuring the strength or prosperity of a nation but it still gives you some useful information, because to have trade routes, you need to have open border agreements with other nations, and therefore how many potential friends they may have in future conflicts. This is nullified when the UN resolution for open trade is passed because trade takes place in if borders are closed. The ratio of Imports to Exports gives you an idea of how much a nation has invested in infrastructure like harbours etc. which give trade bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All in all the demographics screen can be a very useful tool when you understand how it works and the information it provides. When you look at all the different areas as a whole you can get picture of a nation's strengths and weakness, all of which can be used to your advantage. I hope all that I have found can be useful to everyone in their future civving endeavours.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Cultural Victory: Notes and Tips[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]spiceant[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following are (very many) examples of my knowledge about the cultural victory and its aspects. Keep in mind I play on huge maps on emperor difficulty (and win the occasional few).[NEWLINE]I expect people to understand this article at the point where they have learned to win prince difficulty games, on larger then standard maps with default settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some notes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Once you switch your cultural slider to 100%, you will no longer have to worry about happiness, therefore try to maximize the size of your cities for more artist specialists[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. At 100% culture funding you can choose to trade your happiness resources for health ones or money (to pay for the expenses that force your culture slider down below 100%). try to spread the trades equally between leaders so all of the suspicious (backstabbing) leaders will loose a trading deal when declaring war against you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Defensive pacts don't appear to increase your diplomatic backup at the point where other civs decide to or not to declare war you, they do however give you some confidence that you wont be alone when facing war.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Do not use free religion civic when turning the culture slider to 100%, the happiness bonus is negated by the happiness you get from your theaters (+10 happy faces at least). I suggest you use pacifism and caste system.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]5. The emancipation civic has a heavy prerequisite, in addition the "bonus" it gives can be ignored once you flip the culture switch. If you really run low on happiness, build a colosseum.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]6. When facing the choice of building wonders in the 1ad-800ad era you must consider that every turn that it takes longer to finish the wonder will mean that it will take up to 10 turns longer to double its base culture in the future![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]7. the apparently insignificant cultural structures like obelisks and temples can matter very much, as they double the culture they produce quite quickly (as the years pass quickly in the early game). They will also generate a comparatively large amount of culture for their cost, because they will have generated culture since ancient times.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]8. Cultural buildings will generate more culture almost exponentially the earlier they are build, because they will generate culture for longer and will also double their culture/turn earlier (compared to turns instead of years)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]9. Although you won't be warmongering (I presume) you will want a lot of military units, once you turn your cultural slider to over 80% your enemies will get better military techs. Discourage them from taking you over. Defensive units aren't enough, a war of attrition (pillaging of your improvements) can easily ruin you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]10. Although taking a state religion is useful, this will negate the effect of other religions (not their buildings). and will also make heathens more likely to attack you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]11. Once culture is generated, nothing can multiply it, unlike in civIII. if an enemy takes your city however a portion is lost.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]12. Normal speed requires 3 cities with 50K culture, epic 75K, marathon 150K and quick speed requires 3 with 25K.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]13. You can try to calculate how much more culture/turn you need in a city, by sharing the total of amount of remaining required culture by the remaining amount of turns until the deadline (2049AD is to late!!!!), I only suggest this method for making raw estimates.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]14. Cathedrals are great, build as many as you can but don't let them cost you. They cost 10 times the cost of obelisks and require multiple temples per cathedral.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]15. Preserving forests is for the late warmongers or space ship constructors, you want a lot of cottages and the occasional mine for production.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]16. For the cultural victory, there are (usually) 2 phases of your civilization, the development phase and the cocoon phase where you grow into a butterfly. Phase1: build everything that turns up your culture/turn like wonders cathedrals but also the free speech civic (this generates a small portion of the total culture) and Phase2: turn into cocoon, defend your riches and turn your cultural slider 100% generate as much culture as fast as possible, save up the last artists to help your 3rd city over the culture edge,[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]17. Don't do overkill, divide all of your culture equally in between cities, the group (of 3) is only as fast as its slowest member.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buildings will double the amount of culture they generate per turn, after 1000 years[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Marathon speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]total turns: 1200[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 2000 BC (100 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1000 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1700 AD (350 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (350 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Epic speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 660 turns.[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 2000 BC (50 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1000 BC (40 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 200 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1000 AD (80 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1650 AD (130 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1850 AD (100 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD, (200 turns) - &gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Normal speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 460[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 BC (75 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 500 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 1000 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1500 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1800 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1920 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (130 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Quick speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 320 turns:[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]50 Years, until 1000 BC (60 turns)[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1500 AD (20 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1650 AD (15 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1900 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1950 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (100 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The early culture buildings you can build, of which the base culture per turn will be doubled quickly:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]note-1a: estimated earliest research moments are estimated, preassumed your civ has no starting techs.[NEWLINE]note-1b: estimated earliest research moments are also estimated as such that techs are not necessarily rushed to (like the drama or music tech)[NEWLINE]note-2: relative costs are... relatively compared to the sizes of cities and improvements that are available to cities at the time they can be build.[NEWLINE]note-3: the &lt;religion&gt; techs stands for any religion, a &lt;religion&gt; building can be build for each religion, so if you have a jewish town you can make a jewish temple there and later when taoism spreads to it you can also build a taoist temple there. &lt;religion&gt; buildings do not directly affect each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Monastery[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 2 (and +10% science)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Meditation[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Theatre[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 3[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Drama[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 1500BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: Mediocre (or cheap with creative leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: it can be build relatively early, if its build early enough it will have the base culture/turn of a world wonder like the pyramids[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Temple[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 1[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Priesthood[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive (or mediocre with spiritual leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: although the base culture is low, it also adds a happiness face and can also be build early which also means it can generate a significant amount of culture (about 1-3% of total needed for legendary culture status) it can also generate your first great prophet for a &lt;religion&gt; holy shrine. I suggest building it, if you feel confident it does not damage your civs development.[NEWLINE]in the end your still gonna build them because you will certainly want the cathedrals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Obelisk[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 1[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Mysticisms[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3700BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: cheap (it takes only 1 population+slavery or a forest chop)[NEWLINE]*note: although the base culture is very low, it also doubles very quickly if build early and will for that reason generate culture for a very long time, do not underestimate it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Library[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 2 (and +25% to science/turn)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Writing[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3000BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: very expensive[NEWLINE]*note: although it is quite expensive for its time, it can support 2 scientists in a city with a 4 food tile, in a capitol of the &lt;2500BC ages this means double research (and an early great scientist). otherwise you can stick to 1 scientists. Early great scientists are extremely useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Academy[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 4 (and +50% to science/turn)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Writing (this is not the absolute prereq)[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 2300BC[NEWLINE]cost: 1 great scientist[NEWLINE]*note: the academy does NOT double its base culture/turn after 1000 years, oddly. It still has a really nice base culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;religion&gt; Cathedral[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: +50% to the base culture of the city ([BOLD]doesn't[\BOLD] double after 1000 years)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Priesthood &amp; Music[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 500BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: Dead expensive (10 forest chops) its build twice as fast if you get the special resource (copper/marble/stone) for it (varies per religion)[NEWLINE]*[edit 17 jan '06] note: Cathedrals are great, as noted above they are quite costly, they are however the most powerful cultural buildings you can build, get as many as you can but don't loose yourself to them, they cost quite much.[NEWLINE]these cant be build in every city, it takes about 3-4 temples of one specific religion to build a cathedral in one city after that you need to build another 3-4 temples for a 2nd one, that represents this same religion. 3 temples on &lt;standard size maps (i suspect).[NEWLINE]on lower difficulties or on smaller maps it is possible to get more then 3-4 religions that allow you to build cathedrals, on higher difficulties it may not be feasible to get more then 2 cathedrals per religion. It all depends, though.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;religion&gt; Holy shrine[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: +4 (This one DOES double after 1000 years)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: any tech (mysticism/priesthood) that allows you to generate great prophets[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 2000-1000BC, if you build stonehenge early and manage to own a holy city)[NEWLINE]Relative cost: 1 great prophet (on higher difficulties, holy shrines aren't usually profitable because other religion founders spread theirs much faster)[NEWLINE]*note: on lower difficulties holy shrines can be very useful because they generate a lot of money and a nice bit of culture on top of it, the higher the difficulty the lesser the commerce profit. (shrine commerce cannot go to research/culture, it can however pay for expenses that keep your culture/research rate down)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]University[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: +3 (+25% to base science/turn)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Education[NEWLINE]Estimated research moment: to late for double base culture[NEWLINE]relative cost: expensive (or mediocre with philosophical)[NEWLINE]*note: its a nice structure, not much to say.

		<French>[H1]Cultural Victory: Notes and Tips[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]spiceant[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following are (very many) examples of my knowledge about the cultural victory and its aspects. Keep in mind I play on huge maps on emperor difficulty (and win the occasional few).[NEWLINE]I expect people to understand this article at the point where they have learned to win prince difficulty games, on larger then standard maps with default settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some notes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Once you switch your cultural slider to 100%, you will no longer have to worry about happiness, therefore try to maximize the size of your cities for more artist specialists[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. At 100% culture funding you can choose to trade your happiness resources for health ones or money (to pay for the expenses that force your culture slider down below 100%). try to spread the trades equally between leaders so all of the suspicious (backstabbing) leaders will loose a trading deal when declaring war against you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Defensive pacts don't appear to increase your diplomatic backup at the point where other civs decide to or not to declare war you, they do however give you some confidence that you wont be alone when facing war.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Do not use free religion civic when turning the culture slider to 100%, the happiness bonus is negated by the happiness you get from your theaters (+10 happy faces at least). I suggest you use pacifism and caste system.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]5. The emancipation civic has a heavy prerequisite, in addition the "bonus" it gives can be ignored once you flip the culture switch. If you really run low on happiness, build a colosseum.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]6. When facing the choice of building wonders in the 1ad-800ad era you must consider that every turn that it takes longer to finish the wonder will mean that it will take up to 10 turns longer to double its base culture in the future![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]7. the apparently insignificant cultural structures like obelisks and temples can matter very much, as they double the culture they produce quite quickly (as the years pass quickly in the early game). They will also generate a comparatively large amount of culture for their cost, because they will have generated culture since ancient times.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]8. Cultural buildings will generate more culture almost exponentially the earlier they are build, because they will generate culture for longer and will also double their culture/turn earlier (compared to turns instead of years)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]9. Although you won't be warmongering (I presume) you will want a lot of military units, once you turn your cultural slider to over 80% your enemies will get better military techs. Discourage them from taking you over. Defensive units aren't enough, a war of attrition (pillaging of your improvements) can easily ruin you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]10. Although taking a state religion is useful, this will negate the effect of other religions (not their buildings). and will also make heathens more likely to attack you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]11. Once culture is generated, nothing can multiply it, unlike in civIII. if an enemy takes your city however a portion is lost.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]12. Normal speed requires 3 cities with 50K culture, epic 75K, marathon 150K and quick speed requires 3 with 25K.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]13. You can try to calculate how much more culture/turn you need in a city, by sharing the total of amount of remaining required culture by the remaining amount of turns until the deadline (2049AD is to late!!!!), I only suggest this method for making raw estimates.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]14. Cathedrals are great, build as many as you can but don't let them cost you. They cost 10 times the cost of obelisks and require multiple temples per cathedral.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]15. Preserving forests is for the late warmongers or space ship constructors, you want a lot of cottages and the occasional mine for production.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]16. For the cultural victory, there are (usually) 2 phases of your civilization, the development phase and the cocoon phase where you grow into a butterfly. Phase1: build everything that turns up your culture/turn like wonders cathedrals but also the free speech civic (this generates a small portion of the total culture) and Phase2: turn into cocoon, defend your riches and turn your cultural slider 100% generate as much culture as fast as possible, save up the last artists to help your 3rd city over the culture edge,[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]17. Don't do overkill, divide all of your culture equally in between cities, the group (of 3) is only as fast as its slowest member.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buildings will double the amount of culture they generate per turn, after 1000 years[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Marathon speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]total turns: 1200[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 2000 BC (100 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1000 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1700 AD (350 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (350 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Epic speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 660 turns.[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 2000 BC (50 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1000 BC (40 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 200 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1000 AD (80 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1650 AD (130 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1850 AD (100 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD, (200 turns) - &gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Normal speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 460[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 BC (75 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 500 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 1000 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1500 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1800 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1920 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (130 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Quick speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 320 turns:[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]50 Years, until 1000 BC (60 turns)[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1500 AD (20 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1650 AD (15 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1900 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1950 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (100 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The early culture buildings you can build, of which the base culture per turn will be doubled quickly:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]note-1a: estimated earliest research moments are estimated, preassumed your civ has no starting techs.[NEWLINE]note-1b: estimated earliest research moments are also estimated as such that techs are not necessarily rushed to (like the drama or music tech)[NEWLINE]note-2: relative costs are... relatively compared to the sizes of cities and improvements that are available to cities at the time they can be build.[NEWLINE]note-3: the &lt;religion&gt; techs stands for any religion, a &lt;religion&gt; building can be build for each religion, so if you have a jewish town you can make a jewish temple there and later when taoism spreads to it you can also build a taoist temple there. &lt;religion&gt; buildings do not directly affect each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Monastery[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 2 (and +10% science)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Meditation[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Theatre[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 3[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Drama[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 1500BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: Mediocre (or cheap with creative leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: it can be build relatively early, if its build early enough it will have the base culture/turn of a world wonder like the pyramids[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Temple[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 1[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Priesthood[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive (or mediocre with spiritual leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: although the base culture is low, it also adds a happiness face and can also be build early which also means it can generate a significant amount of culture (about 1-3% of total needed for legendary culture status) it can also generate your first great prophet for a &lt;religion&gt; holy shrine.

		<Italian>[H1]Cultural Victory: Notes and Tips[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]spiceant[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following are (very many) examples of my knowledge about the cultural victory and its aspects. Keep in mind I play on huge maps on emperor difficulty (and win the occasional few).[NEWLINE]I expect people to understand this article at the point where they have learned to win prince difficulty games, on larger then standard maps with default settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some notes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Once you switch your cultural slider to 100%, you will no longer have to worry about happiness, therefore try to maximize the size of your cities for more artist specialists[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. At 100% culture funding you can choose to trade your happiness resources for health ones or money (to pay for the expenses that force your culture slider down below 100%). try to spread the trades equally between leaders so all of the suspicious (backstabbing) leaders will loose a trading deal when declaring war against you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Defensive pacts don't appear to increase your diplomatic backup at the point where other civs decide to or not to declare war you, they do however give you some confidence that you wont be alone when facing war.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Do not use free religion civic when turning the culture slider to 100%, the happiness bonus is negated by the happiness you get from your theaters (+10 happy faces at least). I suggest you use pacifism and caste system.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]5. The emancipation civic has a heavy prerequisite, in addition the "bonus" it gives can be ignored once you flip the culture switch. If you really run low on happiness, build a colosseum.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]6. When facing the choice of building wonders in the 1ad-800ad era you must consider that every turn that it takes longer to finish the wonder will mean that it will take up to 10 turns longer to double its base culture in the future![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]7. the apparently insignificant cultural structures like obelisks and temples can matter very much, as they double the culture they produce quite quickly (as the years pass quickly in the early game). They will also generate a comparatively large amount of culture for their cost, because they will have generated culture since ancient times.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]8. Cultural buildings will generate more culture almost exponentially the earlier they are build, because they will generate culture for longer and will also double their culture/turn earlier (compared to turns instead of years)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]9. Although you won't be warmongering (I presume) you will want a lot of military units, once you turn your cultural slider to over 80% your enemies will get better military techs. Discourage them from taking you over. Defensive units aren't enough, a war of attrition (pillaging of your improvements) can easily ruin you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]10. Although taking a state religion is useful, this will negate the effect of other religions (not their buildings). and will also make heathens more likely to attack you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]11. Once culture is generated, nothing can multiply it, unlike in civIII. if an enemy takes your city however a portion is lost.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]12. Normal speed requires 3 cities with 50K culture, epic 75K, marathon 150K and quick speed requires 3 with 25K.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]13. You can try to calculate how much more culture/turn you need in a city, by sharing the total of amount of remaining required culture by the remaining amount of turns until the deadline (2049AD is to late!!!!), I only suggest this method for making raw estimates.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]14. Cathedrals are great, build as many as you can but don't let them cost you. They cost 10 times the cost of obelisks and require multiple temples per cathedral.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]15. Preserving forests is for the late warmongers or space ship constructors, you want a lot of cottages and the occasional mine for production.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]16.

		<Spanish>[H1]Cultural Victory: Notes and Tips[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]spiceant[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following are (very many) examples of my knowledge about the cultural victory and its aspects. Keep in mind I play on huge maps on emperor difficulty (and win the occasional few).[NEWLINE]I expect people to understand this article at the point where they have learned to win prince difficulty games, on larger then standard maps with default settings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some notes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]1. Once you switch your cultural slider to 100%, you will no longer have to worry about happiness, therefore try to maximize the size of your cities for more artist specialists[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]2. At 100% culture funding you can choose to trade your happiness resources for health ones or money (to pay for the expenses that force your culture slider down below 100%). try to spread the trades equally between leaders so all of the suspicious (backstabbing) leaders will loose a trading deal when declaring war against you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]3. Defensive pacts don't appear to increase your diplomatic backup at the point where other civs decide to or not to declare war you, they do however give you some confidence that you wont be alone when facing war.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]4. Do not use free religion civic when turning the culture slider to 100%, the happiness bonus is negated by the happiness you get from your theaters (+10 happy faces at least). I suggest you use pacifism and caste system.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]5. The emancipation civic has a heavy prerequisite, in addition the "bonus" it gives can be ignored once you flip the culture switch. If you really run low on happiness, build a colosseum.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]6. When facing the choice of building wonders in the 1ad-800ad era you must consider that every turn that it takes longer to finish the wonder will mean that it will take up to 10 turns longer to double its base culture in the future![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]7. the apparently insignificant cultural structures like obelisks and temples can matter very much, as they double the culture they produce quite quickly (as the years pass quickly in the early game). They will also generate a comparatively large amount of culture for their cost, because they will have generated culture since ancient times.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]8. Cultural buildings will generate more culture almost exponentially the earlier they are build, because they will generate culture for longer and will also double their culture/turn earlier (compared to turns instead of years)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]9. Although you won't be warmongering (I presume) you will want a lot of military units, once you turn your cultural slider to over 80% your enemies will get better military techs. Discourage them from taking you over. Defensive units aren't enough, a war of attrition (pillaging of your improvements) can easily ruin you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]10. Although taking a state religion is useful, this will negate the effect of other religions (not their buildings). and will also make heathens more likely to attack you.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]11. Once culture is generated, nothing can multiply it, unlike in civIII. if an enemy takes your city however a portion is lost.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]12. Normal speed requires 3 cities with 50K culture, epic 75K, marathon 150K and quick speed requires 3 with 25K.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]13. You can try to calculate how much more culture/turn you need in a city, by sharing the total of amount of remaining required culture by the remaining amount of turns until the deadline (2049AD is to late!!!!), I only suggest this method for making raw estimates.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]14. Cathedrals are great, build as many as you can but don't let them cost you. They cost 10 times the cost of obelisks and require multiple temples per cathedral.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]15. Preserving forests is for the late warmongers or space ship constructors, you want a lot of cottages and the occasional mine for production.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]16. For the cultural victory, there are (usually) 2 phases of your civilization, the development phase and the cocoon phase where you grow into a butterfly. Phase1: build everything that turns up your culture/turn like wonders cathedrals but also the free speech civic (this generates a small portion of the total culture) and Phase2: turn into cocoon, defend your riches and turn your cultural slider 100% generate as much culture as fast as possible, save up the last artists to help your 3rd city over the culture edge,[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]17. Don't do overkill, divide all of your culture equally in between cities, the group (of 3) is only as fast as its slowest member.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buildings will double the amount of culture they generate per turn, after 1000 years[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Marathon speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]total turns: 1200[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 2000 BC (100 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1000 AD (200 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1700 AD (350 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (350 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Epic speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 660 turns.[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 2000 BC (50 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1000 BC (40 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 200 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1000 AD (80 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1650 AD (130 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1850 AD (100 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD, (200 turns) - &gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Normal speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 460[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 BC (75 turns)[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 500 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]20 Years, until 1000 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1500 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1800 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1920 AD (60 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (130 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Quick speed:[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Total turns: 320 turns:[NEWLINE]One turn is[NEWLINE]50 Years, until 1000 BC (60 turns)[NEWLINE]40 Years, until 1000 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]any culture buildings after this point will not generate extra culture/turn, before a realistic deadline[NEWLINE]25 Years, until 1500 AD (20 turns)[NEWLINE]10 Years, until 1650 AD (15 turns)[NEWLINE]5 Years, until 1900 AD (50 turns)[NEWLINE]2 Years, until 1950 AD (25 turns)[NEWLINE]1 Years, until 2050 AD (100 turns) -&gt; time victory condition[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The early culture buildings you can build, of which the base culture per turn will be doubled quickly:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]note-1a: estimated earliest research moments are estimated, preassumed your civ has no starting techs.[NEWLINE]note-1b: estimated earliest research moments are also estimated as such that techs are not necessarily rushed to (like the drama or music tech)[NEWLINE]note-2: relative costs are... relatively compared to the sizes of cities and improvements that are available to cities at the time they can be build.[NEWLINE]note-3: the &lt;religion&gt; techs stands for any religion, a &lt;religion&gt; building can be build for each religion, so if you have a jewish town you can make a jewish temple there and later when taoism spreads to it you can also build a taoist temple there. &lt;religion&gt; buildings do not directly affect each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Monastery[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 2 (and +10% science)[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Meditation[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Theatre[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 3[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Drama[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 1500BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: Mediocre (or cheap with creative leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: it can be build relatively early, if its build early enough it will have the base culture/turn of a world wonder like the pyramids[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]&lt;Religion&gt; Temple[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Base culture/turn: 1[NEWLINE]Research prereq: Priesthood[NEWLINE]Estimated earliest research moment for prereq tech: 3200BC[NEWLINE]Relative cost: expensive (or mediocre with spiritual leader trait)[NEWLINE]*note: although the base culture is low, it also adds a happiness face and can also be build early which also means it can generate a significant amount of culture (about 1-3% of total needed for legendary culture status) it can also generate your first great prophet for a &lt;religion&gt; holy shrine.

		<English>[H1]Beginner's Guide to One City Challenge (OCC)[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Greencardman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Having played the One City Challenge a few times now I've realized that its one of the most exciting ways to play Civ IV, so I decided to write a short article to get people interested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, the One City Challenge (or OCC for short) limits the human player to only one city. The computer players can (and do) build as many cities as they want. Sound hard? Well maybe... The good news is the limits on two national wonders per city are lifted, as are the limits on wonders that require a certain number of building as prerequisites (except monasteries for some reason).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Starting The Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To begin a One City Challenge game you need to go to the custom game menu and check the box marked One City Challenge. Note: while the descriptive text says one city at a time, this is misleading, its one city forever. You can't switch cities even if you capture a nice one from a rival, and cities that culture flip automatically get razed. So be sure you start in a good place, because that's the one and only city you're going to get![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Maps:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since resources are spread out more on larger maps, they're naturally harder to play a OCC game on. If you're feeling brave, go right ahead, but I usually start on a Tiny Pangaea map with 3 Civs. It guarantees you a few good resources on your start.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Victory Conditions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It will probably be a good idea to change the normal victory conditions. A culture win is impossible for a human player on an OCC game, so I usually uncheck that box (note to Firaxis, might want to change that). Also, I usually uncheck the Time and Diplomatic victories as well, since the AI players can expand, they usually gain more points than the human player with one city can. [BOLD]Update:[\BOLD] if you want to play with the Permanent Alliance option on, it allows more variety in an OCC game. Because you are permanently allied with another player, the Cultural victory option becomes available (3 cities with legendary culture) and the Diplomatic and Time victories also become more easily attainable. Its your game, have fun with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Civs:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choose your Civ wisely, because it makes a big difference in this game! As will be mentioned later, health, wonders and great people are key aspects to an OCC game, so I usually pick a Civ with combinations that will help me out in those areas (expansive, philosophical, industrious.) I usually forgo a financial Civ because cottage spamming isn't really a viable option for this game, you just don't have the space.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Early Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Probably the most important part of the game for an OCC player is the early game, because it determines how many wonders will be built, and how quickly Great People will start accumulating. But before we move into too many aspects of the early game, I'd like to cover the key game elements to winning the OCC game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Key Game Elements[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are three key areas an OCC player needs to pay attention to in order to become a significant threat to the AI: health, wonders, and great people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Health:[\BOLD] probably the most important aspect to an OCC game, it determines how large your city can grow. In most OCC games, city size is limited only by health (we'll get into why happiness isn't a problem later). So be sure you maximize your chances for a healthy city! This means moving next to fresh water (+2 health) if you can, and away from jungles and towards forests. Also, one health resource is probably more important than two or more happiness resources, so if you have a choice, chose the health resources. Of course any resources are good, since you can always trade them away for gold, and sometimes for health resources, but be careful, the AI is stingy! The only exception to this is Flood Plains, they provide enough food to give you some specialists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Wonders:[\BOLD] another very important tool in the OCC arsenal (I've always wanted to say that.) Along with their usual benefits, wonders also work at constantly expanding your cultural borders, thereby giving you more territory, and probably more resources. But their most important role is providing the ever important GPP (Great People Points) that keep you ahead of the AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Which leads us to great people, that last key element of an OCC game. I use all forms, but generally I find Great Engineers and Great Prophets to be the most important, especially in the early game. Great Scientists are useful for the Academy they give you, and also for discovering techs, while Great Artists keep your borders expanding constantly, allowing you to take over neighboring resources. Occasionally I get a Great Merchant, but since I play on a small map, they're not too useful, especially in large numbers. Others, however, find them to be incredibly useful, you can read their strategies in later posts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Starting Location and Resources[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now that we've covered some key elements, lets get back to starting our game. To begin with, check out your starting location. Sometimes I keep my settler stationary and explore with my scout to try and find a better area. In an OCC game, its not really what's in your city radius as what's just outside of it. Because your culture expands fairly quickly, you generally get access to resources rather fast. But at some point your borders slow down or the AI builds next to you, which means you should start your city with enough resources 6 to 7 squares away in order to ensure early game access to them. Anything outside of that means you'll have to wait a bit longer for your culture to catch up. So if you have your choice, move closer to health resources and away from happiness ones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a related note, I should mention two other resources that are vitally important to the OCC win: marble and stone. Since they increase wonder production, they're even worth moving away from a health resource to get. Especially if you can get to within 4 or less squares right away. This will allow you to punch a worker out as quickly as possible, by which time your borders will expand enough to envelop the resource, and you can hook it up and start producing wonders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To end the resource discussion, remember that unless you start on the coast you'll never be able to produce workboats to get access to sea-based resources (and the health they provide.) Its very frustrating to see your borders expand to the open ocean, and not be able to do anything about it. So if you notice an abundance of water resources, you may want to start on the coast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Early Game Tech and Production[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since wonders are an important part of an OCC game, I usually beeline for techs that give me wonders. A nice thing about the game is that you don't have to worry about building any settlers! So while the AI is building theirs, you can be starting your first wonder. Usually I build a warrior until the my city reaches a size two, then I switch to a worker, and then finish the warrior and start my first wonder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Religion:[\BOLD] I generally don't bother with starting a religion. Usually I let others spread theirs to me so I can switch depending on who I want to please, plus I don't want to lose turns building the missionaries that make them worth while. Since unhappiness isn't really a factor in an OCC game (usually,) their only worth is monastaries and gold from shrines. Its up to you if you want to make this part of your game, I think either way can work. Just remember, you only have one city, so you have to justify everything you build![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ok, so which Techs to research? I usually start with the worker techs, (animal husbandry, agriculture, the wheel, fishing, mining, masonry) since I really want my worker to get out and start hooking up my resources, especially if there's marble or stone about. Polytheism is also an important tech, because it allows you to build Stonehenge, one of the cheapest wonders. You should also go for Priesthood, to build the Oracle, and Masonry, which allows you to build the Pyramids. After that, you may want to research a few militaristic techs in order to be able to produce something other than Warriors, because barbarians are going to become a problem about this time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, which wonder do you build first? This is actually a hard question. If you build the Pyramids first, your first GP (Great Person) is going to be an engineer, who can rush your second wonder. If you build Stonehenge, it will be a Great Prophet, who provides a substantial gold and hammer boost. I usually chose Stonehenge because it's the cheapest, and the Great Prophet is amazing. Turn them into a super specialists right away, they provide a production boost and start your treasury going. Then I usually build the Oracle for the free tech, and then the Parthenon, for the GP boost. I'll try the Pyramids if nobody has gotten to them yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Rest of the Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This part is rather vague, since I can't really cover how every game will go. But I will note a few things for you to watch out for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First, stay current in your military, and keep building units! You may feel safe seeing six units inside your city, but really you're not! Trust me, you'll always need more. I usually keep a line of defense along my borders on hills and in forests to keep barbarians and other civ's out. Pillaging can kill an OCC city, so don't let the enemy get too close. Also, you need more units than you think. The AI can arrive quickly with a stack that will demolish your city garrison in a heartbeat. Its better to meet them out in the field by playing a defensive game in the forest and on hills. I usually have my worker (I usually only produce one a game) build roads when they have nothing to do. It allows me to get my units out from my city quickly, and attack and withdraw in the same move if need be.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You don't need to build every wonder! Ok, that sounds funny, but I've come close. But some wonders just won't do anything at all for you, so use that time to build military units instead, or produce research if you can. Stay away from maintenance wonders and buildings, which means Versailles and a courthouse, there's no need. You can also forgo ones like Notre Dame, the Spiral Minaret and the Sistine Chapel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So what wonders are important? Probably one of the most important national wonders is the Globe Theater. It eliminates all unhappiness in the city its built in. And hey, you only have one city! If only there was a building like that for health... Since its very important, its often worth it to make a beeline for Theater if you're having problems with happiness. It means you can be at war without worrying about war wariness, and you can also grow as large as you like. It also allows you to trade away your happiness resources for health ones if you can (which is why health resources are more important, once you build the Globe Theater you don't need the happiness ones anymore.) However, be aware that some happiness resources can provide health in connection with some buildings later in the game, so check which ones you've traded, and get them back later if you need to.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other wonders which do a lot of good are the Great Library, The Hanging Gardens and The Parthenon. I generally stay away from wonders which provide small but valuable bonuses across an empire, such as the Statue of Liberty, the Sistine Chapel, the Eiffel Tower, and the Great Lighthouse. It's a hard choice because you only have one city, so it may not be worth it. But if you have the time, have a good amount of military units etc., you may want to go for it, because the bonuses are good, even though small.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may face a problem with happiness in the early/mid game stage. It usually comes at the point at which you've exhausted your happiness resources, but haven't yet been able to build the Globe Theater. A solution to this is researching Monarchy and switching to the Hereditary Rule civic. It gives you +1 happiness per military unit in the city, which means anytime you have an unhappiness problem, just build another unit. Since you always need another unit, this is a good thing. A quick way to get this there is to build the Oracle and use the free tech for Monarchy. Since its usually worth the most beakers, this makes sense anyways, plus you get the added bonus of the civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Don't neglect your health techs: they're very important, so make time for researching them. This means Pottery, (for granaries) Mathematics, (for Aqueducts, and the Hanging Gardens if you can) and Guilds (for Grocers).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use your Great Artists for Culture Bombs: it may seem like a lost cause, but its not, you'll notice your borders moving slowly but surely. Sometimes its even fun, because culture flipped cities automatically raze themselves, so its like watching a blast radiating outwards from your capital in slow motion. Coupled with the culture of your wonders, you can get access to resources three or even 4 squares into your neighbors territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bureaucracy: ahh, the most wonderful of civics. Really, its amazing. Head for Civil Service quickly and pick it up. The +50% boost in production and gold is worth staying with it the rest of the game. Another useful civic is Pacifism, giving you a 100% boost in GP points. I also find Mercantilism to be a somewhat useful tech as well, along with Representation, which provides a nice boost to your science levels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So there you have it, that's all I can think of right now. If I have any more I'll add it later. I hope you enjoy your OCC game.</English>
		<French>[H1]Beginner's Guide to One City Challenge (OCC)[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Greencardman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Having played the One City Challenge a few times now I've realized that its one of the most exciting ways to play Civ IV, so I decided to write a short article to get people interested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, the One City Challenge (or OCC for short) limits the human player to only one city. The computer players can (and do) build as many cities as they want. Sound hard? Well maybe... The good news is the limits on two national wonders per city are lifted, as are the limits on wonders that require a certain number of building as prerequisites (except monasteries for some reason).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Starting The Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To begin a One City Challenge game you need to go to the custom game menu and check the box marked One City Challenge. Note: while the descriptive text says one city at a time, this is misleading, its one city forever. You can't switch cities even if you capture a nice one from a rival, and cities that culture flip automatically get razed. So be sure you start in a good place, because that's the one and only city you're going to get![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Maps:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since resources are spread out more on larger maps, they're naturally harder to play a OCC game on. If you're feeling brave, go right ahead, but I usually start on a Tiny Pangaea map with 3 Civs. It guarantees you a few good resources on your start.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Victory Conditions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It will probably be a good idea to change the normal victory conditions. A culture win is impossible for a human player on an OCC game, so I usually uncheck that box (note to Firaxis, might want to change that).

Polytheism is also an important tech, because it allows you to build Stonehenge, one of the cheapest wonders. You should also go for Priesthood, to build the Oracle, and Masonry, which allows you to build the Pyramids. After that, you may want to research a few militaristic techs in order to be able to produce something other than Warriors, because barbarians are going to become a problem about this time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, which wonder do you build first? This is actually a hard question. If you build the Pyramids first, your first GP (Great Person) is going to be an engineer, who can rush your second wonder. If you build Stonehenge, it will be a Great Prophet, who provides a substantial gold and hammer boost. I usually chose Stonehenge because it's the cheapest, and the Great Prophet is amazing. Turn them into a super specialists right away, they provide a production boost and start your treasury going. Then I usually build the Oracle for the free tech, and then the Parthenon, for the GP boost. I'll try the Pyramids if nobody has gotten to them yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Rest of the Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This part is rather vague, since I can't really cover how every game will go. But I will note a few things for you to watch out for.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First, stay current in your military, and keep building units! You may feel safe seeing six units inside your city, but really you're not! Trust me, you'll always need more. I usually keep a line of defense along my borders on hills and in forests to keep barbarians and other civ's out. Pillaging can kill an OCC city, so don't let the enemy get too close. Also, you need more units than you think. The AI can arrive quickly with a stack that will demolish your city garrison in a heartbeat. Its better to meet them out in the field by playing a defensive game in the forest and on hills. I usually have my worker (I usually only produce one a game) build roads when they have nothing to do. It allows me to get my units out from my city quickly, and attack and withdraw in the same move if need be.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You don't need to build every wonder! Ok, that sounds funny, but I've come close. But some wonders just won't do anything at all for you, so use that time to build military units instead, or produce research if you can. Stay away from maintenance wonders and buildings, which means Versailles and a courthouse, there's no need. You can also forgo ones like Notre Dame, the Spiral Minaret and the Sistine Chapel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So what wonders are important? Probably one of the most important national wonders is the Globe Theater. It eliminates all unhappiness in the city its built in. And hey, you only have one city! If only there was a building like that for health... Since its very important, its often worth it to make a beeline for Theater if you're having problems with happiness. It means you can be at war without worrying about war wariness, and you can also grow as large as you like. It also allows you to trade away your happiness resources for health ones if you can (which is why health resources are more important, once you build the Globe Theater you don't need the happiness ones anymore.) However, be aware that some happiness resources can provide health in connection with some buildings later in the game, so check which ones you've traded, and get them back later if you need to.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other wonders which do a lot of good are the Great Library, The Hanging Gardens and The Parthenon. I generally stay away from wonders which provide small but valuable bonuses across an empire, such as the Statue of Liberty, the Sistine Chapel, the Eiffel Tower, and the Great Lighthouse. It's a hard choice because you only have one city, so it may not be worth it. But if you have the time, have a good amount of military units etc., you may want to go for it, because the bonuses are good, even though small.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may face a problem with happiness in the early/mid game stage. It usually comes at the point at which you've exhausted your happiness resources, but haven't yet been able to build the Globe Theater. A solution to this is researching Monarchy and switching to the Hereditary Rule civic. It gives you +1 happiness per military unit in the city, which means anytime you have an unhappiness problem, just build another unit. Since you always need another unit, this is a good thing. A quick way to get this there is to build the Oracle and use the free tech for Monarchy. Since its usually worth the most beakers, this makes sense anyways, plus you get the added bonus of the civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Don't neglect your health techs: they're very important, so make time for researching them. This means Pottery, (for granaries) Mathematics, (for Aqueducts, and the Hanging Gardens if you can) and Guilds (for Grocers).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use your Great Artists for Culture Bombs: it may seem like a lost cause, but its not, you'll notice your borders moving slowly but surely. Sometimes its even fun, because culture flipped cities automatically raze themselves, so its like watching a blast radiating outwards from your capital in slow motion. Coupled with the culture of your wonders, you can get access to resources three or even 4 squares into your neighbors territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bureaucracy: ahh, the most wonderful of civics. Really, its amazing. Head for Civil Service quickly and pick it up. The +50% boost in production and gold is worth staying with it the rest of the game. Another useful civic is Pacifism, giving you a 100% boost in GP points. I also find Mercantilism to be a somewhat useful tech as well, along with Representation, which provides a nice boost to your science levels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So there you have it, that's all I can think of right now. If I have any more I'll add it later. I hope you enjoy your OCC game.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Beginner's Guide to One City Challenge (OCC)[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Greencardman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Having played the One City Challenge a few times now I've realized that its one of the most exciting ways to play Civ IV, so I decided to write a short article to get people interested.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, the One City Challenge (or OCC for short) limits the human player to only one city. The computer players can (and do) build as many cities as they want. Sound hard? Well maybe... The good news is the limits on two national wonders per city are lifted, as are the limits on wonders that require a certain number of building as prerequisites (except monasteries for some reason).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Starting The Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To begin a One City Challenge game you need to go to the custom game menu and check the box marked One City Challenge. Note: while the descriptive text says one city at a time, this is misleading, its one city forever. You can't switch cities even if you capture a nice one from a rival, and cities that culture flip automatically get razed. So be sure you start in a good place, because that's the one and only city you're going to get![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Maps:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since resources are spread out more on larger maps, they're naturally harder to play a OCC game on. If you're feeling brave, go right ahead, but I usually start on a Tiny Pangaea map with 3 Civs. It guarantees you a few good resources on your start.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Victory Conditions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It will probably be a good idea to change the normal victory conditions. A culture win is impossible for a human player on an OCC game, so I usually uncheck that box (note to Firaxis, might want to change that). Also, I usually uncheck the Time and Diplomatic victories as well, since the AI players can expand, they usually gain more points than the human player with one city can. [BOLD]Update:[\BOLD] if you want to play with the Permanent Alliance option on, it allows more variety in an OCC game. Because you are permanently allied with another player, the Cultural victory option becomes available (3 cities with legendary culture) and the Diplomatic and Time victories also become more easily attainable. Its your game, have fun with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Civs:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choose your Civ wisely, because it makes a big difference in this game! As will be mentioned later, health, wonders and great people are key aspects to an OCC game, so I usually pick a Civ with combinations that will help me out in those areas (expansive, philosophical, industrious.) I usually forgo a financial Civ because cottage spamming isn't really a viable option for this game, you just don't have the space.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Early Game[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Probably the most important part of the game for an OCC player is the early game, because it determines how many wonders will be built, and how quickly Great People will start accumulating. But before we move into too many aspects of the early game, I'd like to cover the key game elements to winning the OCC game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Key Game Elements[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are three key areas an OCC player needs to pay attention to in order to become a significant threat to the AI: health, wonders, and great people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Health:[\BOLD] probably the most important aspect to an OCC game, it determines how large your city can grow. In most OCC games, city size is limited only by health (we'll get into why happiness isn't a problem later). So be sure you maximize your chances for a healthy city! This means moving next to fresh water (+2 health) if you can, and away from jungles and towards forests. Also, one health resource is probably more important than two or more happiness resources, so if you have a choice, chose the health resources. Of course any resources are good, since you can always trade them away for gold, and sometimes for health resources, but be careful, the AI is stingy! The only exception to this is Flood Plains, they provide enough food to give you some specialists.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Wonders:[\BOLD] another very important tool in the OCC arsenal (I've always wanted to say that.) Along with their usual benefits, wonders also work at constantly expanding your cultural borders, thereby giving you more territory, and probably more resources. But their most important role is providing the ever important GPP (Great People Points) that keep you ahead of the AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Which leads us to great people, that last key element of an OCC game. I use all forms, but generally I find Great Engineers and Great Prophets to be the most important, especially in the early game. Great Scientists are useful for the Academy they give you, and also for discovering techs, while Great Artists keep your borders expanding constantly, allowing you to take over neighboring resources. Occasionally I get a Great Merchant, but since I play on a small map, they're not too useful, especially in large numbers. Others, however, find them to be incredibly useful, you can read their strategies in later posts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Starting Location and Resources[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now that we've covered some key elements, lets get back to starting our game. To begin with, check out your starting location. Sometimes I keep my settler stationary and explore with my scout to try and find a better area. In an OCC game, its not really what's in your city radius as what's just outside of it. Because your culture expands fairly quickly, you generally get access to resources rather fast. But at some point your borders slow down or the AI builds next to you, which means you should start your city with enough resources 6 to 7 squares away in order to ensure early game access to them. Anything outside of that means you'll have to wait a bit longer for your culture to catch up. So if you have your choice, move closer to health resources and away from happiness ones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a related note, I should mention two other resources that are vitally important to the OCC win: marble and stone. Since they increase wonder production, they're even worth moving away from a health resource to get. Especially if you can get to within 4 or less squares right away. This will allow you to punch a worker out as quickly as possible, by which time your borders will expand enough to envelop the resource, and you can hook it up and start producing wonders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To end the resource discussion, remember that unless you start on the coast you'll never be able to produce workboats to get access to sea-based resources (and the health they provide.) Its very frustrating to see your borders expand to the open ocean, and not be able to do anything about it. So if you notice an abundance of water resources, you may want to start on the coast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Early Game Tech and Production[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since wonders are an important part of an OCC game, I usually beeline for techs that give me wonders. A nice thing about the game is that you don't have to worry about building any settlers! So while the AI is building theirs, you can be starting your first wonder. Usually I build a warrior until the my city reaches a size two, then I switch to a worker, and then finish the warrior and start my first wonder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Religion:[\BOLD] I generally don't bother with starting a religion. Usually I let others spread theirs to me so I can switch depending on who I want to please, plus I don't want to lose turns building the missionaries that make them worth while. Since unhappiness isn't really a factor in an OCC game (usually,) their only worth is monastaries and gold from shrines. Its up to you if you want to make this part of your game, I think either way can work. Just remember, you only have one city, so you have to justify everything you build![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ok, so which Techs to research? I usually start with the worker techs, (animal husbandry, agriculture, the wheel, fishing, mining, masonry) since I really want my worker to get out and start hooking up my resources, especially if there's marble or stone about. Polytheism is also an important tech, because it allows you to build Stonehenge, one of the cheapest wonders. You should also go for Priesthood, to build the Oracle, and Masonry, which allows you to build the Pyramids.

Turn them into a super specialists right away, they provide a production boost and start your treasury going.

If I have any more I'll add it later. I hope you enjoy your OCC game.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]A Comprehensive Unique Unit Guide[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]aelf[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the War Academy teaches specific strategies involving extensive use of the prominent UUs, there isn't a guide to explain the uses of the others. Strong ones like the Praetorian often need no introduction, but many players are not exposed to the possibilities that the more subtle ones present. What spurred me to start this guide are the fairly common disparaging comments about some UUs, comments that are often simply one-sided.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this guide would help you leverage the different UUs effectively or at least inspire you to be more creative with them. Give all of them a chance! But please note that this guide is written mainly for single player games. Some tips may still be useful for multiplayer, but I can't promise that. This guide also assumes that you are playing as leaders under the normal civs, which might not be true if you are playing BTS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks to [BOLD]Robo Kai, kniteowl, Cabert, Wodan, johnny_rico, gusi, UncleJJ, Bjorn190, dime, s.c.dude, drkodos, kristopherb, Elandal, Thyrwyn, Phrederick, Polycrates, Thedrin, agc28, PraetorianSteve, svv, carl corey, Andrei_V, Mr. Civtastic, Thomas G., GeneralGab, Percy, r_rolo1, facistal, jason77024, GoliathFF8[\BOLD] and [BOLD]InvisibleStalke[\BOLD] for ideas and contributions that helped make this guide possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now I shall begin. The different UUs are listed under their civs, in alphabetical order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]----------[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]America: Navy SEAL (Marine)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you've gotten over the fact that it comes very late in the game, you might realise that the Navy SEAL is actually good UU. A marine replacement, it might seem to be a niche unit. After all, how often do you conduct amphibious attacks (which include those across a river, by the way)? But take a closer look at its unique advantages and you'll realise the potential it has.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its first strike and first strike chances are not to be taken lightly. First strikes can help you deal more damage to the enemy and comfortably win battles that you might otherwise take heavy damage in or even lose. The free March promotion, meanwhile, allows the Navy SEAL to heal on the go, reducing the time it takes to recover before heading off to another battle. Bringing a Medic III unit along with your SEALs means that as soon as they have attacked, they are eligible for the 30% healing the next turn (5% from enemy territory and 25% from Medic III). So as long as they are at or above 16.8/24 strength, they will be back to full health the next turn. They can also heal right after making an amphibious assault aboard a Medic transport. The SEALs in Civ4 are indeed an elite task force worthy of their name, capable of enduring and sustaining a long campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 50% attack bonuses against machine guns and artillery are a thick layer of icing on the cake. With SEALs, you don't have to fret when attacking cities defended by machine guns (which are immune to collateral damage) without tanks. Their first strikes also help by negating the machine gun's first strikes. And, also due to their first strikes, SEALs are probably the best stack protectors against enemy artillery attacks. Divide your stack(s) into smaller SEAL-protected groups and you don't have to worry too much about getting overwhelmed by mass artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you have some coastal cities to assault or a land campaign to conduct, Navy SEALs are an excellent unit to bring along with your invasion force. They do come late, but they come at the right time if you're planning on a late domination push that would win you the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Arabia: Camel Archer (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camel Archers are knights that have a higher withdrawal chance (25%) and don't require horses or iron. You could simply use them like normal knights, but the thing about them is Flanking promotions make them very good at surviving failed attacks (+55% withdrawal chance with Flanking II). This means you don't have to balk so much at attacking a city or a stack that has a defending pike, making them more reliable as an attack unit. Of course, if you end up with no horses or iron, they give you the option of building knights in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you're playing on Warlords, stables can give your Camel Archers enough experience points to start off with Flanking I and II, so you don't have to be running Vassalage or Theocracy. Also, you can improve their ability even further by attaching Great Generals to them as warlords. Give a Flanking II Camel Archer the Tactics promotion (+30% withdrawal chance) and it would have 85% chance of retreating from a failed attack. Of course, you might still get unlucky and lose it, especially if you attack at very low odds. It's not 100% withdrawal chance, you know.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Aztecs: Jaguar Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional whipping boys, these guys get 2 free promotions in Warlords, Woodsman I and Combat I (the latter thanks to Montezuma's Aggressive trait). If you've built those cheap barracks, giving them Woodsman II immediately would allow you to rush a relatively cheap stack of them (Jaguars cost less than normal swordsmen) to enemy cities through forests and jungles, in which they have two moves. Of course, this comes at the price of not being able to give them the City Raider promotion first, but depending on how fortified the target cities are, this may not be such a problem. Jaguars do get the swordsman's inherent 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a more conventional level, the benefit of the Jaguar is probably similar to that of the Gallic Warrior - better stack protection when standing on a particular terrain. Jaguars can even defend against axemen when positioned in forests and jungles, as they get 70% terrain defense bonus there (+50% from the terrain and +20% from Woodsman I), making them good all-round defenders in this situation. Give them Woodsman II or Shock (both available immediately with barracks) and they would have no need to be afraid of axemen as long as they have trees to cover them. Hence, if the enemy's lands sport plenty of foliage, you may want to bring a few of them along in any case. Note that this applies only to [BOLD]jungles[\BOLD] in Civ4 vanilla, where Jaguars get 75% defense bonus (+50% from the terrain and +25% [BOLD]jungle[\BOLD] defense bonus).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jaguars don't require any resource so you can start building them even before hooking up copper or iron. You can also whip them out (probably with unhappy citizens) in newly conquered cities that are not connected to any metal resource, immediately creating some units for either garrison or further offensive purposes and thus helping you proceed with your campaign without having to wait for reinforcements. The value of this UU greatly increases when you find yourself without copper and iron in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More on the no resource requirement, Jaguars are a sure way to rush a neighbour early in the game. You can plant your second city on the best production site in the direction of your target without waiting for copper or iron to be revealed. Then you build barracks and granary, research IW and start whipping Jaguars out without even having to bother with any resources. Get a stack of them and attack Aztec-style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] With the addition of the Woodsman III promotion, Jaguars have become much more useful in an interesting way. Woodsman III grants 2 first strikes, +50% forest and jungle attack and the ability to heal units on the same tile at the rate of 15% per turn. Since Jaguars get Woodsman I for free and barracks can give them Woodsman II off the bat, they are effectively 2 XP away from becoming the ultimate forest/jungle warriors of their time and effective medics. If you need to take out some enemy units that are fortified in a forest/jungle, especially those that are there to choke your cities, unleash the Woodsman III Jaguars. If you need some quick healing, you have Woodsman III Jaguars. A very handy support unit to have around for early warfare. They are probably still not such effective combat units on their own, but the first strikes might help.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can even maximise the Jaguar's healing ability by attaching a Great General to it and giving it all three Medic promotions as well. Woodsman III's healing stacks with the Medic promotions (provided they are on the same unit), giving you a whooping 50% healing rate. And this isn't difficult to achieve since Jaguars get free Combat I (required for Medic I) thanks to Aggressive, so you only need 26 XP to get there. Attaching a Great General to a unit gives you 20 XP, so that Jaguar effectively only needs 6 XP, the first 3 of which can be given by barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthage: Numidian Cavalry (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] This is a UU that people are divided about. Some regard it as a good UU (though not great). Others think it is weak. The latter opinion can usually be attributed to the traditional aversion to horse archers, Horseback Riding (HBR) and Archery (techs required to build horse archer-type units). Horse archers have two moves and are good for busting archer-defended cities, but they die to spearmen, rendering them easy to counter. Archery is widely viewed as a useless dead end tech early on, while HBR is fairly expensive, making it tempting to research other more beneficial techs first. The latter's beaker cost also makes it difficult to ensure that your opponents don't have spears yet by the time it's researched. Add the fact that horse archers suffer from a 10% penalty when attacking cities in Warlords, and that the Numidian Cavalry is 1 strength weaker than normal horse archers, it's easy to turn your back on the Carthaginian UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if you consider it carefully, you may find that it's actually worth something depending on the situation. In Warlords, HBR allows you to build stables (+2 exp to mounted units), which would give your horses an edge in promotions before Vassalage/Theocracy, making the tech more attractive to research early. And the Numidian Cavalry starts with Flanking I, so, with stables, you can give them Flanking II and another promotion (eg. Mobility) right off the bat. This would give them a 50% (20% natural ability + 30% from Flanking I and II) chance to withdraw from losing battles and, if you choose Mobility, the ability to more very quickly even in enemy territory. With the Charismatic trait, it's easy to get your Numidian Cavalry to the next level for yet another promotion. Don't forget that the free Flanking I would not disappear when you upgrade them to knights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those are not all. The Numidian Cavalry also gets 50% bonus vs. melee, as well as the 50% bonus vs. siege that horse archers have, making it virtually an improved axeman. It has no need to be overly afraid of spearmen, thanks to the melee bonus. And you can rely on Flanking II to increase the survival rate of your Numidian Cavalry when up against spears, or you can even the odds with Combat I and Shock. If there's no heavy cultural defense, Numidian Cavalry can do a decent job busting cities on their own, although you'll need a good number of them. As active empire defenders or counter units, they are versatile enough, having bonuses against two categories of units. As pillagers, they are excellent since spears, the easiest counter, are not as effective against them - just be sure to build stables and give them Combat I and Shock (of course, you may want a few Sentries). It may seem like a waste of their free Flanking I, but this way the enemy cannot easily drive your pillaging Numidians out. The few Flanking-promoted ones can attack enemy units guarding key resources. Remember to pillage ivory and horses first, since elephants and horse archers are the most effective counters to your UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cons of the Numidian Cavalry are their reduced strength, the 10% penalty against cities and the fact that they can't get City Raider promotions. Once there's significant cultural defense in an enemy city, expect to take huge losses if you don't bring siege weapons along. Even if there's no cultural defense and the city is not on a hill, Numidian Cavalry are actually not as strong as the city's unpromoted fortified archers, so you need to bring at least twice as many. You can beeline to HBR and rush a neighbour with a moderate stack of them to quickly capture a few cities, but don't expect them to carve out a large empire for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Horse archers no longer get the 10% city attack penalty, so the Numidian Archer is slightly stronger now. It also gains mounted units' flanking attack ability (not to be confused with Flanking promotion), whereby it does 'collateral damage' to siege units in the stack it is attacking, making it better at countering mass catapults than before. These changes certainly mean that Carthage players have something to cheer about.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Celtia: Gallic Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Gallic Warrior is a much-maligned UU. Most people wonder why an offensive unit is given a promotion for hill defense. How on earth is that going to help him attack cities, which is what it does best?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attacking a city is the culmination of an offensive movement, which begins with your entering enemy territory. If you're careful, you would want to move your stack along the safest route to the target city as far as possible, which often means favouring forests and hills over flatlands. This is where the Gallic Warrior's free Guerilla I can help. While spearmen protect your stack against mounted units and axemen/crossbows protect it from melee units, a Gallic Warrior on a hill is the best defender against counterattacking catapults and can even take over the role of the other stack-protection units. For example, if your spearman is badly injured, the Gallic Warrior can defend against chariots or horse archers as long as you're on a hill. Thus, while normal swordsmen may be badly injured before reaching the target city in these circumstances, chances are Gallic Warriors would be in better shape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And note that Gallic Warriors can be promoted with Guerilla II and III. Such units can be a thorn in your enemy's side, running through the hills pillaging mines and maybe raiding a weakly defended city or two, thanks to Guerilla III's movement bonus on hills. The 25% bonus for attacks on hills and 30% withdrawal chance that this promotion gives also make it easier for you to deal with stubborn hill cities. And now that you can build Gallic Warriors with copper in the latest versions of Warlords, this UU can make an extra early appearance for city-busting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another neat thing about this UU is the fact that you can upgrade it to more advanced units in its line without losing the free Guerilla I. So, in effect, the benefit of this UU lasts for a long time. Remember that forests can be chopped but hills are permanent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Somewhat like the Jaguar, this UU benefits from an improvement to its natural promotion branch: the change to Guerrilla III. It still gives +25% hills attack but now it gives a 50% withdrawal chance, making a Guerilla III Gallic Warrior a very effective crack troop. Need to attack that fortified hilltop city before Construction? Guerilla III Gallic Warriors can soften the defenses and have a good chance of surviving even after losing. The 50% withdrawal chance really is quite amazing, outclassing both the Flanking promotions combined. Moreover, since both Celt leaders are Charismatic, it's really easy to get to Guerrilla III. With barracks, your Gallic Warriors can start with Guerilla II and you are only 1XP away from Guerilla III. Sounds like fun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]China: Chukonu (Crossbowman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu has a fearsome reputation. Collateral damage is something well-loved by most Civ4 players, and a respectable non-siege ground unit that has the ability to inflict it would surely become the favourite of some. The biggest weakness of siege units is their inability to defend effectively. The Chukonu, however, can function as an improved crossbowman, thus having an important benefit of siege units without the drawback.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may find it hard to pinpoint the exact role of this UU, though. Crossbows are primarily a counter unit, designed to help eliminate the threat of enemy melee units, and can in turn be countered by mounted units. If the enemy builds stacks of melee, your Chukonus will tear them apart with their bonus vs melee, first strikes and collateral damage. If the enemy mixes his stacks with mounted units, Chukonus are less effective. Thanks to collateral damage and the extra first strikes, however, they are much less helpless than normal crossbows and are still able to attack such mixed stacks, although you would probably sustain losses initially. The idea is to wear the enemy units down with your extra hits and collateral damage. Given enough Chukonus, there's almost nothing you can't defeat in the field (assuming you are facing units of the same era). But the question arises: Are they more cost effective for this purpose than catapults, since the latter are cheaper? If the enemy only has melee units then the answer is clearly yes. If the enemy has mounted units (which may be immune to first strikes) in his stack, sending in a few scuicide catapults first would probably be a better idea. The Chukonus can do semi-cleanup, dealing even more collateral damage to the enemy units and making them extremely weak and easy for more Chukonus or other units to take out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can apply the same concept when attacking a city. Siege units are still needed to remove the city's defenses, but who does the first few assaults would depend on what sort of units are defending the city. If they are macemen and pikemen/spearmen, use your Chukonus. If there are archery/mounted units in the city, use the siege units first, followed by the Chukonus and finally the cleanup crew (if you have any). Remember, Chukonus don't get City Raider promotions, so be prepared to lose some as they attack at lower odds than your CR units might have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu's first strikes are useful on the offense, but they become the primary advantage on the defense. When Chukonus are defending, they won't get to inflict any collateral damage on the enemy units, but their first strikes would be a great boost. First strikes grant chances of hitting the enemy unit before the combat proper even begins, thus improving your odds. The stronger your unit is compared to the enemy's the better first strikes are, since the hits you score would do more damage, thus increasing the possibility of your unit winning without taking much damage. This makes them even better a defense against enemy melee units than normal crossbows. Their first strikes also work well when defending against siege weapons, since they might be able to win before much collateral damage is suffered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you give your Chukonus Drill promotions for more first strikes is up to you. Note that this UU has higher chances of being promoted than normal crossbowmen, since they are more suitable for an offensive role, making it possible to accumulate quite a few Drill promotions and a lot first strikes. Moreover, if you're playing on Warlords, both Chinese leaders are Protective, so Chukonus start with Drill I, giving you a headstart in that line of promotions. Gunpowder units can't choose Drill, so upgraded Chukonus can be interesting. Incidentally, Protective also makes the Chukonu better at defending cities, thanks to the free City Garrison I promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a final note, here's a tip on how to get Chukonus early and really overrun your neighbours: Choose Qin Shi Huang as your leader and aim to build the Oracle to grab Metal Casting (requires Pottery and Bronze Working). The Industrious trait makes getting the Oracle viable, even without marble. Metal Casting leads to Machinery, but it also allows you to build your cheap Industrious forges. Build one asap and run an engineer specialist. When a Great Engineer is born, use him to lightbulb Machinery, giving you access to the Chinese UU very early. But do note that Machinery requires Iron Working and Chukonus need the iron resource to be built, so make sure you get this tech researched while waiting for the GE to be born. The worst scenario is finding no iron in your territory. To help prevent this situation, research Iron Working as quickly as possible to locate iron resources and claim them if necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Egypt: War Chariot (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At 5 strength, the Egyptian War Chariot is essentially an axeman on wheels with no City Raider promotions but has withdrawal chance. It is a very powerful and mobile unit that can win your game from as early as the Ancient Era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An Egyptian player who does not have copper has less to worry about. In fact, horses are much more important for him/her, making Animal Husbandry (AH) a priority. And since Egypt starts with Agriculture, which leads to AH, things are pretty much set up for you. Egypt also starts with The Wheel, which is required to build chariots and roads (to hook up those horses). What serendipity! Feel free to delay Bronze Working till you wish to use Slavery, unless it turns out that there are no horses within reasonable distance. If you discover horses nearby, get a settler there as soon as possible and hook it up. You can then begin preparing for your offensive. Chariot rushing has never been so effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the chariot rush tactic of pillaging the enemy's metal mines should still be applied, War Chariots aren't as afraid of spears as normal chariots because of their increased strength. Additionally, you can give them the Shock promotion to help deal with enemy spears that you might encounter. This would also help vanilla players who face enemy axemen, since the chariot bonus vs. axes applies only after Warlords (vanilla players are somewhat compensated by having 20% withdrawal chance instead of just 10%, though). That said, I have found Flanking promotions a generally better choice when up against spears. Even with Shock, War Chariots have lower odds of winning, so you might as well increase their survival rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little later in the game, a combination of War Chariots and axes would be good to guard against counterattacking spears, since War Chariots don't get defensive bonuses and would almost certainly lose all the time. In most games, axes (and maybe swords) would gradually replace them as the premier city raiders anyway. As enemy cities accumulate more defensive ratings, those spears become more and more costly to dislodge with War Chariots alone. The loss in mobility that would result from this handing over is usually nothing to worry about, since it corresponds roughly to the time when you need to expand at a slower pace until you can get upkeep costs down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Speaking of upkeep, be wary of over-expanding with War Chariots. It's easy to fall into this trap since they pack a good punch so early in the game. While judicious use of them might mean smooth sailing for the rest of the game, their careless use can ruin you as you fall hopelessly behind in terms of technology and development paying upkeep, especially on the higher levels. This and the lack of close neighbours are the greatest early adversaries of the Egyptian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]England: Redcoat (Rifleman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The terror of your enemies in Civ4 vanilla, this unit is dramatically different in Warlords. In the former, it has 16 strength compared to the normal rifleman's 14 and an additional 25% bonus vs. gunpowder units. Hence, they are uber powerful in their era, quite unmatched by any other unit until infantry. The use of the Redcoat on vanilla is, therefore, quite straightforward. Build lots of them and/or upgrade your CR units to them and go on the offensive. Combine them with cannons for even greater effect and watch the colours on the minimap change rapidly. Even grenadiers are unable to counter them effectively due to their additional bonus. The only way the enemy can really fight back is by throwing lots of cannons at them, but you can always spread your stacks out, and the AI isn't likely to do that anyway. Don't let the enemy get machine guns, though. These are a sure counter to Redcoats on the defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, however, it's not so easy. Redcoats have the same base strength as normal riflemen. They only retain their bonus vs. gunpowder units. That said, they are still quite effective. Given no terrain or promotion-based bonuses, no unit of the same era can beat them when they attack. They are vulnerable to attacks by enemy grenadiers now, but still not as badly as in the case of normal riflemen. They own any other unit when defending. You can still use this UU the same way, but more careful planning is required. A proper defense against enemy grenadiers must now be provided for, and cannons play a greater role. Do note that Redcoats have no advantage over normal rifles when attacking cities defended by longbows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, you must consider the Churchill factor as well. The new English leader is Charismatic and Protective, making his gunpowder units especially effective. They start with City Garrison I and Drill I and require fewer xp points get promoted. As city defenders, Churchill's Redcoats are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are also better on the offensive, since Drill helps in any combat situation and, thanks to the free City Garrison, you can better defend newly captured cities against enemy counterattacks. Some players even consider Churchill part of the reason why Redcoats had to be nerfed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A final point on this UU: Drill IV Redcoats are formidable. They get a total of 5 first strikes and a chance at another (immunity from first strikes are rare enough post-Gunpowder), an extra 10% bonus vs. mounted units and an amazing 60% reduction of any collateral damage sustained. These units are likely to take less damage in every way and win more often. And, in Warlords, Drill counts as a prerequisite promotion towards Cover, Formation and other "vs unit type" promotions. Hence, units with Drill are not condemned by not choosing Combat, should the need for those promotions arise. Especially valuable is the availability of Pinch as a promotion, since it helps to neutralise the threat of attacking grenadiers. The trouble is gunpowder (and melee) units don't get Drill promotions, so it's only possible to create such units by upgrading your archery units to Redcoats, which requires you to set aside a tidy sum. To make matters worse, archery units are generally not used offensively and are thus difficult to promote. However, the good news is Churchill players can do this more easily. With the Protective trait giving free Drill I to your archery units and Charismatic making promotions easier to obtain, you can use crossbows (the most likely candidate, since it has greater offensive value compared to archers and longbows) extensively in the hopes of getting some of them up to Drill IV to be upgraded later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Redcoat has indirectly been improved from its Warlords version since all gunpowder units can now receive Drill promotions. That means elite Drill Redcoats are much closer to reality, especially for Churchill. Gone are the days when you have to upgrade archery units to get them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ethiopia: Oromo Warrior (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Musket UUs generally don't get a lot of love, although the ones that the game has to offer are actually quite useful. But even if you're really not a fan of musket UUs, give the Oromo Warrior a try before you knock it. It is immune to First Strikes and starts with Drill I and II promotions; that means 2-3 First Strikes and -20% to collateral damage received out of the box. And if you throw the experience from barracks in, you get Drill III Oromo Warriors straight off the assembly line. Just add in Theocracy/Vassalage or a military instructor and you can be training Drill IV Oromos. Naturally, this UU has a potentially high survival rate, even after being battered by siege weapons (thanks to the Drill promotions' protection against collateral damage of up to 60%). They will perform normal muskets' defensive role extra well, and you need not be so hesitant about using them to attack even when faced with knights. Longbows are also less of a worry since Oromos are immune to First Strikes. Moreover, they are draftable, and you can get Drill III draftees with just Theocracy/Vassalage/a military instructor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If those aren't enough, you needn't worry so much about this musket UU getting obsolete quickly (BTS has delayed the advent of grenadiers to prolong the life of muskets anyway) because the promotions will remain on them when they are upgraded to riflemen. You might have read about the elusive elite Drill IV Redcoats. Well, with Ethiopia, Drill IV riflemen are a lot easier to come by. Suddenly those enemy cannons are not so scary anymore, are they?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]France: Musketeer (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they are 1 strength point weaker than knights, musketmen have no hard counter in their time, which is the whole point of this unit. Also, knights don't get defensive bonuses so they are not as good at defending. Musketmen fare well as an all-round stack protector. And when one of your cities is threatened, wouldn't it be ideal to have a versatile defender that can counterattack as well? Remember that musketmen can be drafted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, think of the potential uses of Musketeers, which are musketmen with 2 moves. They can reinforce any threatened city quickly, which makes them potentially more effective as city defenders than longbowmen. And when you need stack protection during a campaign, Musketeers, besides being an insurance that covers you against everything except knights and Pinch elephants (both of which you can simply counter by bringing pikes), are also able to pillage along the way with the extra move (which can be useful for taking out strategic resources). Not just that, their speed means you can have reserves catching up with your stack to take over the role of their wounded comrades should your stack come under attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Offensively, they have their uses as well. Musketeers can do clean-up work when all your siege weapons and CR units have spent their move attacking, since they have 9 base strength and aren't countered by any particular unit. And, of course, they are great for a pillaging campaign. Mix them with pikemen in small stacks and they can move and pillage within a single turn and with near impunity. Versatility is the name of the Musketeer game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A major gripe that people have about this UU is the fact that it obsoletes too quickly, since Chemistry is effectively only a few techs away. Moreover, nothing upgrades to muskets and you have to build them from scratch, further narrowing their window of opportunity. The Musketeers' speed actually helps to alleviate this problem, since you can get them to the frontline to be used a lot more quickly compared to normal musketmen. Also, researching Nationalism and switching to Nationhood to draft can help you get enough of them out in time to be used to full effect. You can stay in Nationhood and research towards Rifling next, so that you can soon start drafting riflemen to complete your offensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this note, there's another interesting use for Musketeers. Try postponing Chemistry and beelining to Military Tradition for early cavalry. Research techs along the Education route, be the first to get Liberalism and grab Nationalism as the free tech. Then research Gunpowder (which is also needed for cavalry), start drafting/building Musketeers (you may use them first if you want), research Military Tradition (requires Music, which you should trade for) and start building cavalry. Escort your cavalry with Musketeers and either launch a lightning campaign or pillage with impunity. Only Musketeers can keep up with cavalry while protecting them against costly counterattacks by enemy pikes. Flanking cavalry often prevail against longbow-defended cities by themselves with relatively low casualty rates, so even if you plan on taking cities, there might not be a need to bring slow siege weapons along. If you do this right, you can finish off one or two neighbours just like that, before they can build riflemen to counter your cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Germany: Panzer (Tank)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite being the latest UU in the game, the Panzer really packs a punch. A tank with 50% bonus versus armour units, it will eat other tanks alive and beat even modern armour. This gives them the power to dominate the battlefield. Just watch out for those gunships, which are an effective counter to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you get Panzers before the enemy gets Flight, you can solve this problem by beelining for enemy oil wells and pillaging them to prevent him/her from building a single gunship in the first place. This should be relatively easy to do, since the enemy can't stop you with his/her own tanks. Once that is done, you'd be facing mostly gunpowder units, against which the Pinch promotion would be effective in the field. With it, the Panzer can match even mech infantry, unless the latter is better promoted or is receiving defensive bonuses. And with the free Blitz promotion that tanks have, a stack of Panzers can annihilate up to double the number units in a turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When taking cities, the Panzer might only be as effective as a normal tank, since you are likely to face many gunpowder units, which receive defensive bonuses unlike armour units. But that is alright, since tanks are excellent at taking cities anyway, having access to both Barrage and City Raider promotions. After you've chewed through the toughest defenders, whatever armour is sitting in the city would be easy pickings. Apply the blitzkrieg strategy by using your bombers to soften city defenses before rapidly moving in with your City Raider Panzers. Be sure to have some Drill Panzers to clean up, since they are good at taking out the weaker units without suffering much damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem with this UU is how late it appears. It is enabled by Industrialism but requires oil, which means you have to get Combustion and build oil wells in addition to it, placing it even later in the timeline than Navy SEALs. Many players would have won the game by then, or at least they would be in such dominant or winning positions that having Panzers would have little influence on the outcome. Once you get them, however, they can last till the end of the game. Their ability to stand up to modern armour means you can delay getting Composites and survive without aluminum. Even if modern armour is already available, you would probably want to leave some of your Panzers un-upgraded as a versatile counter to enemy armour. Of course, you must have oil to build Panzers in the first place. Being German and not having oil in the later eras in a tightly contested game would be a shame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greece: Phalanx (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx, derided by some, is in fact one of the stronger UUs in the game. With 5 strength and +25% hill defense (not to be confused with free Guerilla promotion), it has enough qualities to set it far above normal spearmen. Don't forget that it also gets free Combat I from Alexander's Aggressive trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx is essentially a super spearman. However, if you build them early enough in single player, chances are the AI might not have anything except archers. Thus, it would do just as well as the axeman when used as a rush unit, except that it holds the ground better on hills and isn't afraid of Warlords' chariots (which get +100% attack vs. axemen). The fact that the Greeks start with Hunting (which is required to build the UU) certainly helps if you are thinking of rushing with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In its conventional role, the Phalanx also boasts a very long lifespan of more than two eras. Elephants give normal spearmen cause to worry, while knights are too strong be countered well by them. Phalangites, however, are able to counter elephants effectively and hold their own against knights. When they are defending on hills, no mounted unit before cavalry can beat them one-on-one without having at least the Shock promotion (perhaps with the exception of the melee-busting Conquistadors). They are also good at defending on hills, especially in hill cities, against most units in the Ancient and Classical eras. A truly solid package for a UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Phalanx has, for better or worse, been changed in BTS. It is now an axeman that is not vulnerable to chariots. That means chariots do not get a 100% bonus when attacking them. This effectively transforms a defensive UU into an offensive one, as Greek players need not worry about having to protect their earliest city raiding units from chariots. If you are the kind of player who says the glass is half empty, this change at most saves you from having to build a few spearmen and to research Hunting before you begin an axe rush. But if you like to say the glass is half full, this makes a strong rush unit that is exactly like the axeman in vanilla, which can only be countered by another axeman. Indeed, saving you the effort of building spearmen can be crucial in the early game, when cities are few and hammers are scarce. It can mean a few extra Phalanxes, which might decide whether you can take and hold a (or an extra) city or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the defense, the new Phalanx also performs decently in the early game. Now you don't have to build spearmen to deal with the occasional pillaging chariot, though of course spears would be more effective. Not having to build spearmen might also mean having extra Phalanxes to defend against an enemy axe rush. You might prefer the old version of this UU, but you can't say the new one isn't useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Inca: Quechua (Warrior)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dubbed by some as one of the worst UUs when Civ4 was still new, the Quechua has gained notoriety through the Quechua rush, a strategy that might win you a Deity game even if it's far above your current skill level. How is that possible, you ask? Quechuas are cheap at 15 hammers each (cheaper than half an axeman) and they get a 100% bonus against archers, the AI's primary/only city garrison unit early in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush is simple to do. You can probably start building Quechuas in the beginning and overwhelm the nearest AI capital with numbers (provided you've located it, of course). However, it's advisable that you build a worker, barracks and another worker first. The first worker would improve food resources (for whipping), build mines and chop trees, while the second would start building a road to the nearest AI capital (which, presumably, you would have found by then) and make logistics less of a nightmare. The barracks allows your capital to grow in between the worker builds, but, more importantly, it allows you to build Quechuas with Cover. In vanilla, Huayna Capac is Aggressive and hence Quechuas get Combat I free, allowing you to promote them with Cover immediately if you've built a barracks. Even though the Inca leader is no longer Aggressive in Warlords, Quechuas still get Combat I free, so this tactic still applies. Quechuas with Cover have a much higher chance of winning against fortified archers so you don't need as many of them. You would be able to capture one AI city after another much more quickly. This method also has the benefit of allowing the AIs to settle more cities before you attack, thus giving you early game expansion possibilities without having to build your own settlers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have the workers and barracks (and have researched Mining and Bronze Working), you can start building, chopping or whipping Quechuas out. If copper is discovered within your territory, you can supplement your rush with axemen, who can gradually take over as your main city raiders, ensuring that your offensive is longer-lasting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush does have its limitations. It requires a close neighbour. Otherwise, it would take too long to get there and you would have to pay an unreasonable amount of distance upkeep if you succeed in capturing the city. Of course, you can resort to razing, but this strategy would then lose half its value. It also assumes that the AI builds archers to defend itself. On that note, you need to be playing at a high enough difficulty, where the AI can either build archers immediately or soon enough. Warriors might be too cost-effective for Quechuas to be facing, even though you can choose the Shock promotion instead of Cover. A higher difficulty level also means the AI is likely to start with a free settler or two and would thus have more cities up for grabs when you begin your rush. The AI may also conveniently choose to settle his cities towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside to this rush is the relatively high amount of unit upkeep that you have to pay early in the game. Coupled with the distance maintenance you have to pay for captured cities, your early technological development might be retarded for a while. You can, however, count on being able to catch up fairly quickly if you've nabbed an especially powerful neighbouring capital. Huayna's Financial trait can also help you recover more quickly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond this strategy, the Quechua's usefulness is quite limited. They are effective against barbarians, since those often take the form of archers, and would hence perform well under raging barbs setting. They are also better than normal warriors at worker stealing (since they survive better against archers), should you choose to be aggressive from the start even though you have no plans of capturing enemy cities yet. Besides these, it's hard to conceive of another way to exploit this UU without rushing, making it rather situational. It either shines or fades into relative oblivion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]India: Fast Worker (Worker)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Fast Worker is a worker with 3 moves (which, interestingly enough, is unmatched till gunships in the modern age). This means, with all their moves unspent, they can enter forest/jungle/hill and immediately begin improving the tile without ending their turn. However, they do end their turn if they enter a forested/jungled hill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indirectly, this means the Fast Worker is faster at doing what workers do. It does not improve tiles faster, but being able to begin earlier in many situations would translate to a lot of saved worker turns by the end of the game. By the way, yes, it is the only UU that lasts throughout the game. Their extra movement also means they are able to cover distances more quickly, allowing you to move them around your empire efficiently. This enables a much tighter worker strategy, where you can have fewer workers improving tiles in different cities according to which city would grow and work the tiles next. To put it simply, playing as India, you do not need as many workers to develop your land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To get the most out of this UU, adopt an early worker strategy (i.e. building a worker first). You'd develop much quicker than the other civs and could use this early game lead to your advantage for the rest of the game. Their 3 moves also make them excellent scouts, especially early on when revealing your surroundings quickly is crucial. Just make sure you keep them away from animals and barbs. With their speed, it shouldn't be that difficult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some players do not like the fact that it is not a military UU, but few would be able to argue against its merits. The only downside to the Fast Worker is the fact that slower game speeds diminish their advantage, since the turns saved by their extra movement would be less and less significant compared to the increased number turns needed to improve tiles. If you're playing on Quick or Normal speed, this UU is certainly amazing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Japan: Samurai (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cool factor aside, there seems to be little that is interesting about this UU at first glance. It is a regular maceman that cannot be built with copper (requiring specifically iron) and has 2 first strikes. The second thing is what gives the Samurai its power, and which has sparked considerable debate on how useful it makes this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After much testing and debate, it is generally agreed that the 2 first strikes are a great boon. They help the Samurai survive, even at lower odds, and give them an edge against archers and longbows, the primary city defenders of the day. First strikes essentially mean that the unit gets the chance to inflict damage on the enemy unit even before the combat proper begins. Both archers and longbows get 1 first strike, which help them deal with regular city attackers (i.e. units with access to City Raider promotions, such as macemen), but have this advantage cancelled out by one of the Samurai's first strikes. And the Samurai still has another first strike to use. This also applies to crossbowmen (who also get 1 first strike), making the Samurai less vulnerable to that effective anti-melee unit. And, just as importantly, this advantage also has the effect of giving Samurais a higher chance to win battles while suffering less damage. That means they are potentially able to recover faster for another attack, thereby shortening the length of the Japanese player's campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But do take note that this bonus is not the same as getting free Drill promotions (to which, by the way, macemen do not have access). It is better than merely a free Drill I, but it will not remain when you upgrade your Samurais. And beware of knights (especially Conquistadors or those with Shock promotion). They are a fast and effective counter to Samurai, since they have enough strength and ignore first strikes, so bring enough pikemen when facing a sufficiently advanced opponent who has researched Guilds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawback of the Samurai is the requirement of iron. While regular macemen can be built with copper as well, without iron, the Japanese player will be stuck without his/her UU or even regular macemen. Thankfully, this strategic resource is quite commonly available. But if you do find yourself not having one readily available, planting a city in the tundra or invading your neighbour to get it might be worth the effort before the age of the Samurai arrives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Korea: Hwacha (Catapult)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] If you like axemen, you'd love the Hwacha. It is a catapult with 50% bonus vs melee units, making it an axeman with collateral damage, bombard ability and withdrawal chance for a mere five hammers more (Normal speed). The only downside is the Hwacha doesn't receive defensive bonuses like an axeman, so you might want to use your Hwachas offensively and turn up the heat so the enemy is forced to defend in his nice cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hwacha has some interesting synergy with Wang Kon's Protective trait. Protective really shines when you have no metals and are forced to adopt a defensive position with archers in the early game. Construction represents the departure from such a stance, since you're now able to build catapults and attack. Hwachas, being super catapults, puts you in an even better position to go on the offensive, with Protective archers/longbows for support as defenders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have iron, Protective crossbows and spears/pikes are perfect companions to Hwachas. They eliminate the threat of enemy melee and mounted units and help defend new possessions while your Hwachas take down enemy defenders. You don't need axemen. A few swords to help clean up can complete your arsenal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When macemen and trebuchets come into the picture, Hwachas gradually take a back seat, but not before you can deal some serious damage to a neighbour or two. Nonetheless, a Korean player would benefit from picking up Construction as quickly as possible. Why not put this powerful weapon into use as early as you can? And Wang Kon's Financial trait can certainly help with that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Unfortunately, as it stands, the Hwacha has been weakened by the inability of siege weapons to kill units and to gain more than 1 experience point per battle. Its bonus still applies, but you can no longer rely on a stack of Hwachas to actually capture cities for you. You also need enough units to kill off all the weakened defenders. While this job can be done by almost any non-siege unit, this means hammers probably need to be diverted to other units, resulting in fewer Hwachas built. Then there's the 1xp only rule, which is worse since it means your Hwachas can no longer gain valuable additional promotions through combat, making it less effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of this UU has certainly been reduced. You can still make good use of it much in the same way as before, but remember to build more units for clean up duty and to take up the slack caused by fewer veteran Hwachas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mali: Skirmisher (Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skirmishers are archers with 4 strength and 1 extra first strike chance, effectively making Mali half a Protective civ until Feudalism comes around. With them, Malinese cities are certainly not ones to be taken easily in the early game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The normal use of Skirmishers is pretty straight forward: Defend your cities or hill improvements with them. As such, they play a rather passive role as a UU. This puts into question the rationale of going straight for Archery, even when playing Mali. First, you don't start with Hunting (required for Archery). Second, the threat of barbarian or enemy axes make axemen a better unit for defense, since they are able to counterattack and prevent your improvements from being pillaged. Lastly, Bronze Working is needed for Slavery anyway, and if you happen to find copper nearby after researching it you can soon build axes. Skirmishers can help with defense if you don't find copper around, but in that case you might want to beeline to Iron Working, so Hunting and Archery are still not the priority. But of course, in the worst case scenario where you find no metal around, Skirmishers can become quite important.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords improves Skirmishers a little by making chariots a counter to axes. Now you don't have to fear barbarian/enemy axemen if you don't have copper but have horses. Barb spearmen, if they do appear, can be countered somewhat by Skirmishers. You can thus concentrate on teching up with chariots and Skirmishers for defense, without having to beeline for the relatively expensive Iron Working. If you want to be aggressive, you can rush a neighbour with a stack of chariots and some Skirmishers. The latter can help secure newly conquered cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now for the less conventional. If you are going for a really quick rush as Mali, you can beeline to Archery from the beginning. Skirmishers don't require resources, so you can technically rush a neighbour with them Jaguar-style. Get Archery as quickly as possible, build barracks - maybe settle a second city - and start building Skirmishers. After you several of them, rush the nearest neighbour's capital. Skirmishers are better than normal archers, so with a ratio of about 3:1 in your favour, you may be able to overwhelm the defending archers. The surviving Skirmishers would then help you hold on to the conquered city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you whip to rush build Skirmishers for this tactic, becareful of the hammer overflow. You might quickly begin to whip them out for one population point each and run into serious happiness issues. If you want to try this rush, you should have a food-plenty and hilly area (i.e. a good production city site) as the site of your capital. You'll need the hammers because you'll be building most of the Skirmishers the slow way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mongolia: Keshik (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keshiks are horse archers that ignore terrain movement cost and get 1 first strike, but aren't immune to first strikes. Hence, they are extremely adept at raiding and pillaging, but aren't as good at attacking archers/longbows with Drill promotions. This has a few implications on a Mongolian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surprise is the best asset of the Keshiks. Ignoring terrain movement cost means they can traverse forests/jungles and hills as easily as flatlands. Thus, it is easy for a Mongolian player to strike across difficult terrain at the unlikeliest of places, grabbing unguarded workers and lightly-defended cities or pillaging improvements (especially on strategic resources). However, this advantage relies on the enemy's inability to counterattack immediately with spearmen or a superior force, so good intelligence would be needed to know where exactly the enemy places his spears and the bulk of his units. If you do not have this luxury, you could always send more Keshiks in case you meet spears, but be prepared to lose quite a few of them. In addition, you could pillage enemy roads to eventually cripple his ability to counterattack. However, at the end of the day, the strategic advantage you gain from your harassment must outweigh the lost hammers you spent on the dead Keshiks[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Keshiks' first strike, meanwhile, makes them better than normal horse archers at picking off non-spear units in your territory or in the enemy's. Combined with their terrain movement advantage, this makes them good empire defenders and hit-and-run units. Unfortunately, the enemy can easily counter them by having spearmen guard his units, so this might only work effectively against the AI. There's also a limitation on how good Keshiks are in fighting non-spear units compared to normal horse archers. The immunity to first strikes that normal horse archers get makes them better at fighting archery units with Drill promotions or units with Drill III/IV. The Keshiks' own first strike can only negate one of the enemy units' first strikes. To remedy this, you have to give your Keshiks Flanking II so that they get immunity to first strikes as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This, in turn, highlights the Keshik's relative weakness (compared to normal horse archers) in attacking cities defended by Drill-promoted archery units. In Warlords, this means Protective civs are better covered against attempts to take cities with Keshiks. The 10% city attack penalty that the horse archer unit-type gets in Warlords makes them even less desirable as city raiders. Thus, the only hope Mongolian player might have in using Keshiks to conquer in Warlords is to rely on speed, Flanking promotions and numbers (also applies to vanilla, but not to such a large extent).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With barracks and Ger in the city, a Keshik gets 7 xp upon being built. Unfortunately, that will still allow for only 2 initial promotions (unless you're running both Vassalage and Theocracy for a total of 11 xp), though of course your mounted units would be promoted to the next level sooner. But, at any rate, 2 initial promotions are good enough. Give most of the Keshiks Flanking I and II to give them 50% withdrawal chance each (including the natural 20%) and immunity to first strikes. Give Combat I and Medic I or Combat I and Shock (for defending against spearmen) to the rest. Have at least one Medic I Keshik and one Shock Keshik in each stack. If you get Compass early enough, you can use explorers (strength 4, ignores terrain movement cost and starts with free Guerilla I and Woodsman I) to help protect your stacks when they stop on hills or forests/jungles. 3 or 4 cities with Gers pumping out Keshiks would usually be good enough to amass a sizeable army in reasonable time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As your Keshiks attack enemy cities, some will die, some will withdraw and some will win. The medics will ensure that the withdrawing and winning Keshiks heal up more quickly. If you manage to overwhelm a prepared enemy with numbers, your speed advantage (from ignoring terrain movement cost and faster healing) will ensure that the enemy cannot fight back or resist as effectively, hastening his destruction. If the enemy is unprepared in the first place, your speed advantage will ensure his quick defeat. Note that this strategy can only work if the enemy doesn't have longbows yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You should be prepared to build courthouses and marketplaces to help you keep your winnings. But even if you're not, you can just resort to razing and pillaging for some barbaric fun. Long live the Golden Horde![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Netherlands: East Indiaman (Galleon)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Now here's an interesting UU. Although it does have some combat capability, it serves primarily as a support unit. But the East Indiaman is pretty good at it, offering an extra cargo space for a total of 4, which is quite a big leap from a normal galleon considering the fact that transports have the same capacity. If you're planning on waging war during the age of the rifle, especially against an overseas civ, or if you are planning a large-scale settling another landmass, you don't have to build quite as many ships to carry your units over. Three East Indiamen carry as much as four galleons, thereby saving you 80 hammers, which can almost make an extra frigate (90 hammers) to protect your fleet. Moreover, since they carry as many units as transports, you might not need to decommission or upgrade them till the end of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The East Indiaman also has the nifty ability to travel within rival borders without needing an open borders treaty. Have you accumulated much EPs thanks to the Financial trait? You can send your spies anywhere in the world conveniently, even directly into an unfriendly overseas civ. And the extra cargo space is useful for espionage as well, helping you keep a constant flow of spies even if many get caught.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly, the East Indiaman has 2 more strength than a normal galleon, making it tougher to sink. While it still can't beat a frigate, it can more than annihilate caravels and destroy other galleons, so you have naval superiority at Astronomy until your rivals get Chemistry and build frigates. And, should there be privateers prowling the seas, you needn't worry so much about being ambushed by them while moving units across water without escort during peacetime. This is probably a UU that you would appreciate on maps with lots of seas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ottomans: Janissary (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Janissary's advantage is a 25% boost against melee, archery and mounted units, making it a great all-round unit for its time. It is pretty much effective against all previous era units (with the big exception of siege units), so you can potentially put some serious hurt in your enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to get as much use out of Janissaries as possible, you need to look for ways to get to Gunpowder early. You might even want to make a beeline for it, either through the northern path (Maths -&gt; Currency -&gt; Priesthood? -&gt; Civil Service -&gt; Paper -&gt; Education) or the southern path (Metal Casting -&gt; Machinery &amp; Monotheism -&gt; Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guilds) in the tech tree. Different lightbulbing strategies are available (with Great Merchants for the southern path and Great Scientists for the northern one), so you don't have to self-research everything. Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do a beeline, but it's probably the best way. The point is to get to Gunpowder before your enemies are even close to it, and rapidly exploiting this opportunity gap by building, whipping and possibly drafting as many Janissaries as you can to use against them. To be able to draft, you would need to pursue the northern path and probably research Liberalism first to grab Nationalism as the free tech, before actually researching Gunpowder. It is a slight diversion, but it may be worth the delay if your empire does not have the capability to build or whip enough Janissaries in time to give you a real edge, as often is the case.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have them, Janissaries are quite a fearsome force in the medieval battlefield. They have no hard counter, so the best bet your enemies might have is to promote their units with Pinch, which requires Gunpowder in Warlords. Knights with Pinch, however, are a good counter to Jannissaries, as are regular musketmen (against whom Janissaries have no advantage whatsoever), so once your enemies have Gunpowder as well you may find your edge disappearing. If they manage to get to Chemistry, which isn't that far away, this UU is practically obsolete. Janissary stacks are actually relatively vulnerable to siege units (and the associated collateral damage) as well, since they don't get any bonuses against these. But unless you're playing MP, this shouldn't be a big problem. The AI does not generally build many catapults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also take note that Janissaries may not be the best city-taking troops you can get, since they do not have access to City Raider promotions. Needless to say, if you're relying on them as the backbone of your army, you still need to bring siege weapons along if you hope to grab some enemy territory. Given the fact that they are not actually very different from the conduct of normal campaigns of the time, Janissary campaigns might still be slow going, so don't be surprised if you don't manage to knock out more than one enemy with them, even with your best efforts (assuming you're playing on the higher levels). Hence, the emphasis is again on getting them as early as possible so as to enlarge the window of opportunity that you have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Overall, without the mobility of the Musketeer, this UU is quite situational and, to an even higher degree than the former, requires some long term planning in the early game to be put to good use. It is probably better the lower the difficulty you play on, since you would be more likely to out-tech the AIs and get to Gunpowder much earlier than them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Persia: Immortal (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It seems odd that Immortals are chariot-replacements, and you may miss the ownage days of playing as Persia with their Civ3 incarnation. Fortunately, they are still very effective in Civ4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you have horses and a neighbouring civ nearby, you know you're in for some fun. Immortals get 50% bonus vs. archery units, as well as an innate 30% withdrawal chance. No AI I've seen can resist them very early in the game. Hook up those horses quickly, build/whip out some of these creatures and head straight for the neighbour. If you managed to build barracks, you can give them Flanking I for an extra 10% withdrawal chance. If you have time to kill some barbs as well, before heading for your neighbour's cities, you can promote some with Flanking II for immunity against first strikes and a total of 60% withdrawal chance. This would give them a high survival rate against archers. Don't they sound like excellent AI city busters? What's more, they do get defensive bonuses, making them less vulnerable to counterattack and decent garrison units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If or when your enemy gets spearmen, however, Immortals lose much of their power. Even one spearman in a city you're attacking can give you a lot of trouble. You really have to count on the withdrawal chances if you want the first few Immortals to survive a direct attack on the city. In Civ4 vanilla, enemy axemen would be a problem too, since chariots don't get the 50% bonus when attacking axemen like in Warlords. To help prevent difficulties from arising, you should pillage any AI mine that you see sitting on a metal resource. If a city is on top of one, pillage the roads around it to limit spear production to that city. You would thus prolong the effectiveness of your Immortals. Until your enemy gets Feudalism, that is. If he can. Although the 50% bonus also applies when fighting longbows, the latter are too strong when defending in cities to be dislodged by Immortals alone. The same may be said of enemy crossbows. But with the help of siege weapons, Immortals can still take them down quite easily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem is when there is no neighbour near you. In that case, you can't use Immortals to their full potential. However, they are still quite handy against barbs, since the latter usually take the form of archers. In Warlords, they are also great for dispatching barb axemen. Clearly, the expansion has given this solid UU even more oomph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Rome: Praetorian (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians are a blunt instrument with which you can rule the early battlefield. Taking cities is the name of the game, and Praetorians easily destroy enemy archers defending cities (even those with some cultural defense), with odds so favorable that they'll likely not suffer losses. You may lose a few if the enemy city is on a hill and the defender has City Garrison promotions, but the odds will still favor you most of the time. You probably want to give your Praetorians City Raider (CR) promotions to help bust those cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because of their high strength, Praetorians can hold their own against axeman, their natural counter. Nevertheless, it may be best to build your own axemen or promote a few Praetorians with Combat I and Shock for stack defense. Praetorians will also prevail against mounted units of the same era, though a spearman or two will only do you good, leaving your Praetorians to focus on taking those cities. After the enemy gets longbowmen, the Praetorian is still useful, but you need to support them with catapults to remove city defenses and soften up the defenders to avoid catastrophic losses. Watch out for crossbows, though; they are very effective against Praetorians. The best way to guard against them is to pillage the enemy's iron mines before he/she can build them. The same goes for enemy Shock war elephants, in which case you should pillage his/her ivory camps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians require Iron Working and iron. A Roman player would probably want to take advantage of the Praetorian as early as possible, so beelining to Iron Working is a good call. You may want to have a settler and some workers ready to exploit any iron deposit you see as soon as the tech is researched, although there's some chance that you'd find iron within your existing borders. You should also build barracks first, so that you can give your Praetorians a promotion from the get go, whether it is CR 1 for city busting or Combat 1 for Shock later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The problem with Praetorians is the Roman player may become a victim of his own success. Because it is so easy to expand quickly with this UU, the temptation to expand beyond your limit is great. You may end up too many cities, causing your economy to crash from the upkeep. One solution is to raze cities rather than keep them, unless they are close to yours or have high value (eg. capitals, holy cities or those with wonders). This also has the effect of severely weakening or even eliminating your enemies so it is easier to actually expand when your economy is able to support it later. And, while you're doing this, do pillage the improvements around razed cities to set your enemies back even further and for extra funds. You can also help yourself by building up your infrastructure at home to support your campaigns, such as laying down lots of cottages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This UU is the main reason why it's good to play as Rome when you're new on a difficulty level. Try not to get too used to having them, though, as you might become too dependent on their strength to play with any other civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Russia: Cossack (Cavalry)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the Redcoat, the Cossack is one UU that has been changed in Warlords. In Civ IV vanilla, the Cossack has a fearsome reputation. A cavalry with 18 strength and +50% against mounted units on top of the ordinary cavalry capabilities (+50% against cannon and 30% withdrawal chance), it can beat almost every unit in its era. Even riflemen, its counter, have less strength if you don't consider promotions or defensive bonuses. Pinch-promoted Cossacks can eat them alive. Riflemen need to be one level higher (4) and get the Formation promotion to even out the playing field, though you should note that Aggressive riflemen can get Formation at level 3. Redcoats do counter Cossacks very well, but Cossacks are faster, can withdraw and aren't destroyed by machine guns and massed cannons the way Redcoats are.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you are using them in the vanilla game, consider getting them as early as possible by beelining to Education, getting Liberalism and choosing Nationalism as the free tech. Nationalism leads to Military Tradition (requires Music, so make sure you trade for it) and Education leads to Gunpowder, techs needed to build Cossacks (and you must have horses, of course). If you pull this off early enough, the rest of the game should be easy - Cossacks versus longbowmen is no contest. You can shoot for a domination victory right away. All you need to do is keep pumping out Cossacks, with the whip whenever possible, while ideally running the military civics (Vassalage and Theocracy) to give your Cossacks an even bigger edge. It's no wonder that some people consider them overpowered in vanilla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords, however, is a vastly different game for Cossack fans. On one hand, there's the introduction of the stable, which improves mounted units by giving them 2 more experience points. On the other hand, the Cossack has the same strength as normal cavalry now, only retaining their bonus against mounted units. They are basically cavalry that excel in killing other cavalry. This is a lot more useful in MP, where cavalry versus cavalry is pretty much a fair game and you need to get riflemen to gain an advantage. Having Cossacks means you already have an advantage against enemy cavalry, forcing your enemies to tech to riflemen to stand a chance on the battlefield or risk being holed up in their cities and becoming sitting targets for your cannons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In SP, however, much of the action would ideally take place at enemy cities to begin with, and in this respect the Cossack is mostly as good as normal cavalry in Warlords. It can get the 2 extra experience points from stables, but so can normal cavalry. The only time you have a real advantage against the AI is when it masses cavalry. In that case, your Cossacks would cut through the AI's army like knife through butter. Unfortunately, you would probably have to capture cities to end the war anyway. That said, Cossacks are pretty good for pillaging if you promote them with Pinch, since they would then be more difficult to counter (neither riflemen nor cavalry would work effectively against them). But, still, as you can see, what was an amazing UU has become a pretty situational one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spain: Conquistador (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this UU, the road to El Dorado can be wide and clear. It has the potential to be exploited in a game-breaking way. The reason is this: Conquistadors get 50% bonus vs. melee, which gives it an advantage against the most common counter to knights - pikemen. They also get defensive bonuses, which means they can exploit the terrain to make counterattack difficult. To top all of this off, Conquistadors benefit from 2 first strikes (which normal knights don't get), making them even harder to defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need horse and iron to produce this UU. Playing as Spain, I'd make sure I get those by the time Conquistadors can be built. The Spanish player would also do well to research Guilds early, extending the life and usefulness of the UU. Conquistadors can fill the role of your main city attackers, following your siege weapons to capture city after city. They don't get CR upgrades, but they can perform decently against city defenders even when they haven't accumulated promotions. Their first strikes and immunity to first strikes certainly help, especially against longbows. And, thanks to their bonus against melee, defending pikes don't scare them that much. With defensive bonuses to help, they can also act as stack-protectors during your campaigns. Furthermore, since they have 2 moves, they can attack enemy units and come back to the stack in the same turn. If you're playing on Warlords, they make the perfect companions to Citadel-improved siege weapons. Woe to the enemy cities![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once those shiny cities have been taken, Conquistadors can help defend them until you get suitable defenders (such as longbowmen) there. This works especially well if a city is on a hill. As you can see, the versatility of the Conquistador almost matches that of the Musketeer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, here are a few words of caution. Siege weapons are not to be excluded from your Conquistador campaigns. Unless your target is still fielding archers, bringing siege units for bombardment and some collateral damage should still be part and parcel of your plans. Conquistadors are strong but not invincible. Without the proper support, they would still die to entrenched units, especially pikes and longbows. The other thing is, beware of elephants! These are the ultimate counter to Conquistadors. Under normal circumstances, there is no way a Conquistador can beat an elephant, and the latter is much cheaper to train. Just make sure you target opponents who have no ivory and you should have great time conquering with this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vikings: Berserk (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] Hate them or love them, Berserks are a popular UU. Although, not as powerful as their Civ3 incarnation, these guys can really be useful. Their 10% bonus vs. cities is certainly nice. However, for many people the problem is finding a good use for their free Amphibious promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings have a higher potential to rule on water maps than any other civ. Ragnar is Financial, which means coastal tiles produce 3 commerce instead of 2, and his UB allows his ships to move further earlier in the game by giving free Navigation promotion. Combined with the Berserk's ability to attack amphibiously with no penalty and its city attack bonus, a Viking player on a water map can fast tech to Civil Service and Machinery and have fun raiding enemy coastal cities with Berserks on fast galleys. One method to do this early is building the Oracle and grabbing Metal Casting as the free tech (which, by the way, gives access to Colossus for a further boost to those coastal tiles). Then build/whip a forge and run an engineer in a city without the Oracle. Research your way to Code of Laws and Civil Service a.s.a.p. (in the pre-patch version you can use a prophet generated by the Oracle to lightbulb CoL/CS by not researching Masonry). In the meantime, build several galleys to prepare for your sea adventures. You'll get a Great Engineer as your 1st or 2nd Great Person from the forge city. Use him to lightbulb Machinery and start building Berserks. You could also put your research slider at 0% for a few turns and upgrade some axes to Berserks (being Financial helps with accumulating money for that). If you catch your opponents without longbows yet, you've done really well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are limitations to your Berserks' ability to raid cities from the sea, though. If a city is defended by longbows, on a hill, has high cultural defense and/or walls, it could be difficult to take and might render an attempt not worth the cost. To attack such a city, you probably need to bring siege units along as galleys/triremes are not able to even bombard the city's defenses. Having to land siege units to bombard/deal collateral damage nullifies the Berserks' amphibious advantage. As such, you would need to look for softer targets to strike at. You don't have to keep the city. Find a weak spot (a lightly defended coastal city), raid, raze and pop back into the galleys before the enemy can counterattack. Landing a spear with the Berserker that has to land on that turn would help the latter survive a counterattack by mounted units (the most likely reaction you'll get from an AI). But becareful not to attack too close to an AI capital. AIs tend to stack more units in their capitals and can easily counterattack with a stronger force from there. Humans in MP will be wary of a sea attack, so watch out for axes/xbows in or within reach of coastal cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even if you're not playing on a water map, Berserks present some interesting options. With them, you have the advantage when laying siege to a city across a river if the enemy doesn't have Engineering. His non-mounted units cannot counter attack from the city without suffering a 20% penalty for attacking across the river. With their free Amphibious promotion, Berserks get no such penalty attacking the city. The only downside is your siege units do suffer from the penalty if you want to cause some collateral damage first. Conversely, this idea works in defense as well. When enemy units are across a river beside one of your cities, you can attack them with your Berserks with no penalty while they would suffer it when they attack. At the very least, Berserks always get their 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the most valuable thing about the Berserk is the fact that he keeps the Amphibious promotion when upgraded. This allows a Viking player to build Berserks (especially City Raider ones) and upgrade them later on to grenadiers or riflemen with free Amphibious. Frigates are able to bombard city defenses, so you can get yourself an elite amphibious attack force long before marines make their appearance. The free Amphibious also works the opposite way, allowing your older units to benefit from it when upgraded to Berserks. Hence, it makes sense to do so with all of your more experienced axemen or swordsmen. It would almost certainly be worth the money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Zulus: Impi (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] On the surface, the Impi may not appear to be a stellar UU, since it does not come with extra strength or with obviously strong bonuses. However, the tactical value of this unit is considerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Impi comes with the Mobility promotion (-1 movement cost to enter tiles that would normally cost 2 moves or more) and 2 moves. Thus, they have the ability to rapidly cross territory and catch another nation with a weakly defended city in the early game, when borders are not really expanded and cultural defenses are not high. They can be two tiles from a city and attack it on the same turn that war is declared. Thanks to Aggressive, they also start with Combat I, making them a little stronger. Furthermore, they are eligible for City Raider promotions, which would help crack the defenses of those early cities. Their relatively low cost, meanwhile, helps you amass a number of them as quickly as possible and simply bum rush a close neighbour.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They also make excellent pillagers. With the 100% bonus against mounted that spears get, the only units that can really catch them are not able to kill them effectively. Naturally, they can be put in your stacks or cities to defend and make counterattacks against mounted units. In your own territory, no enemy horse can hope to outrun them, so it's death to the common enemy pillagers![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An interesting gambit you can try is attaching a Great General to an Impi and giving him the Morale promotion, thus creating a 3-move unit with reduced terrain movement cost. If you manage to get it beyond Combat IV, you can add Commando to the collection. It's not going to be a particularly strong unit, but it might have some interesting tactical uses (such as running into a weakly defended part of an enemy empire to killl a worker and then getting out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, Impis have good synergy with the Zulu UB, the Ikhanda, which is a barrack that also acts as a mini courthouse (-20% maintenance cost for the city). Grab some cities from an unsuspecting opponent as outlined above and rush build Ikhandas in them to help pay for the early extra maintenance. Moreover, being Aggressive, Shaka builds his UB at double production speed, so it's more power to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zulus start conveniently with Hunting, which is required to build their UU, but Impis need copper or iron to be built. If you want to use them as an early attack unit, you must beeline to BW and find copper. If there's no copper around, well, then there's no hope for an Impi rush. The other downside to them is the fact that Mobility becomes useless when you upgrade them, unless you continue doing so all the way till they become mech infantry. No matter what, unroaded terrain would cost at least 1 movement point to enter and, except for mech infantry much later, the Impi's line of units only has 1 move each.</English>
		<French>[H1]A Comprehensive Unique Unit Guide[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]aelf[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the War Academy teaches specific strategies involving extensive use of the prominent UUs, there isn't a guide to explain the uses of the others. Strong ones like the Praetorian often need no introduction, but many players are not exposed to the possibilities that the more subtle ones present. What spurred me to start this guide are the fairly common disparaging comments about some UUs, comments that are often simply one-sided.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this guide would help you leverage the different UUs effectively or at least inspire you to be more creative with them. Give all of them a chance! But please note that this guide is written mainly for single player games. Some tips may still be useful for multiplayer, but I can't promise that. This guide also assumes that you are playing as leaders under the normal civs, which might not be true if you are playing BTS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks to [BOLD]Robo Kai, kniteowl, Cabert, Wodan, johnny_rico, gusi, UncleJJ, Bjorn190, dime, s.c.dude, drkodos, kristopherb, Elandal, Thyrwyn, Phrederick, Polycrates, Thedrin, agc28, PraetorianSteve, svv, carl corey, Andrei_V, Mr. Civtastic, Thomas G., GeneralGab, Percy, r_rolo1, facistal, jason77024, GoliathFF8[\BOLD] and [BOLD]InvisibleStalke[\BOLD] for ideas and contributions that helped make this guide possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now I shall begin. The different UUs are listed under their civs, in alphabetical order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]----------[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]America: Navy SEAL (Marine)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you've gotten over the fact that it comes very late in the game, you might realise that the Navy SEAL is actually good UU. A marine replacement, it might seem to be a niche unit. After all, how often do you conduct amphibious attacks (which include those across a river, by the way)? But take a closer look at its unique advantages and you'll realise the potential it has.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its first strike and first strike chances are not to be taken lightly. First strikes can help you deal more damage to the enemy and comfortably win battles that you might otherwise take heavy damage in or even lose. The free March promotion, meanwhile, allows the Navy SEAL to heal on the go, reducing the time it takes to recover before heading off to another battle. Bringing a Medic III unit along with your SEALs means that as soon as they have attacked, they are eligible for the 30% healing the next turn (5% from enemy territory and 25% from Medic III). So as long as they are at or above 16.8/24 strength, they will be back to full health the next turn. They can also heal right after making an amphibious assault aboard a Medic transport. The SEALs in Civ4 are indeed an elite task force worthy of their name, capable of enduring and sustaining a long campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 50% attack bonuses against machine guns and artillery are a thick layer of icing on the cake. With SEALs, you don't have to fret when attacking cities defended by machine guns (which are immune to collateral damage) without tanks. Their first strikes also help by negating the machine gun's first strikes. And, also due to their first strikes, SEALs are probably the best stack protectors against enemy artillery attacks. Divide your stack(s) into smaller SEAL-protected groups and you don't have to worry too much about getting overwhelmed by mass artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you have some coastal cities to assault or a land campaign to conduct, Navy SEALs are an excellent unit to bring along with your invasion force. They do come late, but they come at the right time if you're planning on a late domination push that would win you the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Arabia: Camel Archer (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camel Archers are knights that have a higher withdrawal chance (25%) and don't require horses or iron. You could simply use them like normal knights, but the thing about them is Flanking promotions make them very good at surviving failed attacks (+55% withdrawal chance with Flanking II). This means you don't have to balk so much at attacking a city or a stack that has a defending pike, making them more reliable as an attack unit. Of course, if you end up with no horses or iron, they give you the option of building knights in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you're playing on Warlords, stables can give your Camel Archers enough experience points to start off with Flanking I and II, so you don't have to be running Vassalage or Theocracy. Also, you can improve their ability even further by attaching Great Generals to them as warlords. Give a Flanking II Camel Archer the Tactics promotion (+30% withdrawal chance) and it would have 85% chance of retreating from a failed attack. Of course, you might still get unlucky and lose it, especially if you attack at very low odds. It's not 100% withdrawal chance, you know.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Aztecs: Jaguar Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional whipping boys, these guys get 2 free promotions in Warlords, Woodsman I and Combat I (the latter thanks to Montezuma's Aggressive trait). If you've built those cheap barracks, giving them Woodsman II immediately would allow you to rush a relatively cheap stack of them (Jaguars cost less than normal swordsmen) to enemy cities through forests and jungles, in which they have two moves. Of course, this comes at the price of not being able to give them the City Raider promotion first, but depending on how fortified the target cities are, this may not be such a problem. Jaguars do get the swordsman's inherent 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a more conventional level, the benefit of the Jaguar is probably similar to that of the Gallic Warrior - better stack protection when standing on a particular terrain. Jaguars can even defend against axemen when positioned in forests and jungles, as they get 70% terrain defense bonus there (+50% from the terrain and +20% from Woodsman I), making them good all-round defenders in this situation. Give them Woodsman II or Shock (both available immediately with barracks) and they would have no need to be afraid of axemen as long as they have trees to cover them. Hence, if the enemy's lands sport plenty of foliage, you may want to bring a few of them along in any case. Note that this applies only to [BOLD]jungles[\BOLD] in Civ4 vanilla, where Jaguars get 75% defense bonus (+50% from the terrain and +25% [BOLD]jungle[\BOLD] defense bonus).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jaguars don't require any resource so you can start building them even before hooking up copper or iron. You can also whip them out (probably with unhappy citizens) in newly conquered cities that are not connected to any metal resource, immediately creating some units for either garrison or further offensive purposes and thus helping you proceed with your campaign without having to wait for reinforcements. The value of this UU greatly increases when you find yourself without copper and iron in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More on the no resource requirement, Jaguars are a sure way to rush a neighbour early in the game. You can plant your second city on the best production site in the direction of your target without waiting for copper or iron to be revealed. Then you build barracks and granary, research IW and start whipping Jaguars out without even having to bother with any resources. Get a stack of them and attack Aztec-style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] With the addition of the Woodsman III promotion, Jaguars have become much more useful in an interesting way. Woodsman III grants 2 first strikes, +50% forest and jungle attack and the ability to heal units on the same tile at the rate of 15% per turn. Since Jaguars get Woodsman I for free and barracks can give them Woodsman II off the bat, they are effectively 2 XP away from becoming the ultimate forest/jungle warriors of their time and effective medics. If you need to take out some enemy units that are fortified in a forest/jungle, especially those that are there to choke your cities, unleash the Woodsman III Jaguars. If you need some quick healing, you have Woodsman III Jaguars. A very handy support unit to have around for early warfare. They are probably still not such effective combat units on their own, but the first strikes might help.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can even maximise the Jaguar's healing ability by attaching a Great General to it and giving it all three Medic promotions as well. Woodsman III's healing stacks with the Medic promotions (provided they are on the same unit), giving you a whooping 50% healing rate. And this isn't difficult to achieve since Jaguars get free Combat I (required for Medic I) thanks to Aggressive, so you only need 26 XP to get there. Attaching a Great General to a unit gives you 20 XP, so that Jaguar effectively only needs 6 XP, the first 3 of which can be given by barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthage: Numidian Cavalry (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] This is a UU that people are divided about. Some regard it as a good UU (though not great). Others think it is weak. The latter opinion can usually be attributed to the traditional aversion to horse archers, Horseback Riding (HBR) and Archery (techs required to build horse archer-type units). Horse archers have two moves and are good for busting archer-defended cities, but they die to spearmen, rendering them easy to counter. Archery is widely viewed as a useless dead end tech early on, while HBR is fairly expensive, making it tempting to research other more beneficial techs first. The latter's beaker cost also makes it difficult to ensure that your opponents don't have spears yet by the time it's researched. Add the fact that horse archers suffer from a 10% penalty when attacking cities in Warlords, and that the Numidian Cavalry is 1 strength weaker than normal horse archers, it's easy to turn your back on the Carthaginian UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if you consider it carefully, you may find that it's actually worth something depending on the situation. In Warlords, HBR allows you to build stables (+2 exp to mounted units), which would give your horses an edge in promotions before Vassalage/Theocracy, making the tech more attractive to research early. And the Numidian Cavalry starts with Flanking I, so, with stables, you can give them Flanking II and another promotion (eg. Mobility) right off the bat. This would give them a 50% (20% natural ability + 30% from Flanking I and II) chance to withdraw from losing battles and, if you choose Mobility, the ability to more very quickly even in enemy territory. With the Charismatic trait, it's easy to get your Numidian Cavalry to the next level for yet another promotion. Don't forget that the free Flanking I would not disappear when you upgrade them to knights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those are not all. The Numidian Cavalry also gets 50% bonus vs. melee, as well as the 50% bonus vs. siege that horse archers have, making it virtually an improved axeman. It has no need to be overly afraid of spearmen, thanks to the melee bonus. And you can rely on Flanking II to increase the survival rate of your Numidian Cavalry when up against spears, or you can even the odds with Combat I and Shock. If there's no heavy cultural defense, Numidian Cavalry can do a decent job busting cities on their own, although you'll need a good number of them. As active empire defenders or counter units, they are versatile enough, having bonuses against two categories of units. As pillagers, they are excellent since spears, the easiest counter, are not as effective against them - just be sure to build stables and give them Combat I and Shock (of course, you may want a few Sentries). It may seem like a waste of their free Flanking I, but this way the enemy cannot easily drive your pillaging Numidians out. The few Flanking-promoted ones can attack enemy units guarding key resources. Remember to pillage ivory and horses first, since elephants and horse archers are the most effective counters to your UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cons of the Numidian Cavalry are their reduced strength, the 10% penalty against cities and the fact that they can't get City Raider promotions. Once there's significant cultural defense in an enemy city, expect to take huge losses if you don't bring siege weapons along. Even if there's no cultural defense and the city is not on a hill, Numidian Cavalry are actually not as strong as the city's unpromoted fortified archers, so you need to bring at least twice as many. You can beeline to HBR and rush a neighbour with a moderate stack of them to quickly capture a few cities, but don't expect them to carve out a large empire for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Horse archers no longer get the 10% city attack penalty, so the Numidian Archer is slightly stronger now. It also gains mounted units' flanking attack ability (not to be confused with Flanking promotion), whereby it does 'collateral damage' to siege units in the stack it is attacking, making it better at countering mass catapults than before. These changes certainly mean that Carthage players have something to cheer about.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Celtia: Gallic Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Gallic Warrior is a much-maligned UU. Most people wonder why an offensive unit is given a promotion for hill defense. How on earth is that going to help him attack cities, which is what it does best?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attacking a city is the culmination of an offensive movement, which begins with your entering enemy territory. If you're careful, you would want to move your stack along the safest route to the target city as far as possible, which often means favouring forests and hills over flatlands. This is where the Gallic Warrior's free Guerilla I can help. While spearmen protect your stack against mounted units and axemen/crossbows protect it from melee units, a Gallic Warrior on a hill is the best defender against counterattacking catapults and can even take over the role of the other stack-protection units. For example, if your spearman is badly injured, the Gallic Warrior can defend against chariots or horse archers as long as you're on a hill. Thus, while normal swordsmen may be badly injured before reaching the target city in these circumstances, chances are Gallic Warriors would be in better shape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And note that Gallic Warriors can be promoted with Guerilla II and III. Such units can be a thorn in your enemy's side, running through the hills pillaging mines and maybe raiding a weakly defended city or two, thanks to Guerilla III's movement bonus on hills. The 25% bonus for attacks on hills and 30% withdrawal chance that this promotion gives also make it easier for you to deal with stubborn hill cities. And now that you can build Gallic Warriors with copper in the latest versions of Warlords, this UU can make an extra early appearance for city-busting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another neat thing about this UU is the fact that you can upgrade it to more advanced units in its line without losing the free Guerilla I. So, in effect, the benefit of this UU lasts for a long time. Remember that forests can be chopped but hills are permanent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Somewhat like the Jaguar, this UU benefits from an improvement to its natural promotion branch: the change to Guerrilla III. It still gives +25% hills attack but now it gives a 50% withdrawal chance, making a Guerilla III Gallic Warrior a very effective crack troop. Need to attack that fortified hilltop city before Construction? Guerilla III Gallic Warriors can soften the defenses and have a good chance of surviving even after losing. The 50% withdrawal chance really is quite amazing, outclassing both the Flanking promotions combined. Moreover, since both Celt leaders are Charismatic, it's really easy to get to Guerrilla III. With barracks, your Gallic Warriors can start with Guerilla II and you are only 1XP away from Guerilla III. Sounds like fun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]China: Chukonu (Crossbowman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu has a fearsome reputation. Collateral damage is something well-loved by most Civ4 players, and a respectable non-siege ground unit that has the ability to inflict it would surely become the favourite of some. The biggest weakness of siege units is their inability to defend effectively. The Chukonu, however, can function as an improved crossbowman, thus having an important benefit of siege units without the drawback.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may find it hard to pinpoint the exact role of this UU, though. Crossbows are primarily a counter unit, designed to help eliminate the threat of enemy melee units, and can in turn be countered by mounted units. If the enemy builds stacks of melee, your Chukonus will tear them apart with their bonus vs melee, first strikes and collateral damage. If the enemy mixes his stacks with mounted units, Chukonus are less effective. Thanks to collateral damage and the extra first strikes, however, they are much less helpless than normal crossbows and are still able to attack such mixed stacks, although you would probably sustain losses initially. The idea is to wear the enemy units down with your extra hits and collateral damage. Given enough Chukonus, there's almost nothing you can't defeat in the field (assuming you are facing units of the same era). But the question arises: Are they more cost effective for this purpose than catapults, since the latter are cheaper? If the enemy only has melee units then the answer is clearly yes. If the enemy has mounted units (which may be immune to first strikes) in his stack, sending in a few scuicide catapults first would probably be a better idea. The Chukonus can do semi-cleanup, dealing even more collateral damage to the enemy units and making them extremely weak and easy for more Chukonus or other units to take out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can apply the same concept when attacking a city. Siege units are still needed to remove the city's defenses, but who does the first few assaults would depend on what sort of units are defending the city. If they are macemen and pikemen/spearmen, use your Chukonus. If there are archery/mounted units in the city, use the siege units first, followed by the Chukonus and finally the cleanup crew (if you have any). Remember, Chukonus don't get City Raider promotions, so be prepared to lose some as they attack at lower odds than your CR units might have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu's first strikes are useful on the offense, but they become the primary advantage on the defense. When Chukonus are defending, they won't get to inflict any collateral damage on the enemy units, but their first strikes would be a great boost. First strikes grant chances of hitting the enemy unit before the combat proper even begins, thus improving your odds. The stronger your unit is compared to the enemy's the better first strikes are, since the hits you score would do more damage, thus increasing the possibility of your unit winning without taking much damage. This makes them even better a defense against enemy melee units than normal crossbows. Their first strikes also work well when defending against siege weapons, since they might be able to win before much collateral damage is suffered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you give your Chukonus Drill promotions for more first strikes is up to you. Note that this UU has higher chances of being promoted than normal crossbowmen, since they are more suitable for an offensive role, making it possible to accumulate quite a few Drill promotions and a lot first strikes. Moreover, if you're playing on Warlords, both Chinese leaders are Protective, so Chukonus start with Drill I, giving you a headstart in that line of promotions. Gunpowder units can't choose Drill, so upgraded Chukonus can be interesting. Incidentally, Protective also makes the Chukonu better at defending cities, thanks to the free City Garrison I promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a final note, here's a tip on how to get Chukonus early and really overrun your neighbours: Choose Qin Shi Huang as your leader and aim to build the Oracle to grab Metal Casting (requires Pottery and Bronze Working). The Industrious trait makes getting the Oracle viable, even without marble. Metal Casting leads to Machinery, but it also allows you to build your cheap Industrious forges. Build one asap and run an engineer specialist. When a Great Engineer is born, use him to lightbulb Machinery, giving you access to the Chinese UU very early. But do note that Machinery requires Iron Working and Chukonus need the iron resource to be built, so make sure you get this tech researched while waiting for the GE to be born. The worst scenario is finding no iron in your territory. To help prevent this situation, research Iron Working as quickly as possible to locate iron resources and claim them if necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Egypt: War Chariot (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At 5 strength, the Egyptian War Chariot is essentially an axeman on wheels with no City Raider promotions but has withdrawal chance. It is a very powerful and mobile unit that can win your game from as early as the Ancient Era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An Egyptian player who does not have copper has less to worry about. In fact, horses are much more important for him/her, making Animal Husbandry (AH) a priority. And since Egypt starts with Agriculture, which leads to AH, things are pretty much set up for you. Egypt also starts with The Wheel, which is required to build chariots and roads (to hook up those horses). What serendipity! Feel free to delay Bronze Working till you wish to use Slavery, unless it turns out that there are no horses within reasonable distance. If you discover horses nearby, get a settler there as soon as possible and hook it up. You can then begin preparing for your offensive. Chariot rushing has never been so effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the chariot rush tactic of pillaging the enemy's metal mines should still be applied, War Chariots aren't as afraid of spears as normal chariots because of their increased strength. Additionally, you can give them the Shock promotion to help deal with enemy spears that you might encounter. This would also help vanilla players who face enemy axemen, since the chariot bonus vs. axes applies only after Warlords (vanilla players are somewhat compensated by having 20% withdrawal chance instead of just 10%, though). That said, I have found Flanking promotions a generally better choice when up against spears. Even with Shock, War Chariots have lower odds of winning, so you might as well increase their survival rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little later in the game, a combination of War Chariots and axes would be good to guard against counterattacking spears, since War Chariots don't get defensive bonuses and would almost certainly lose all the time. In most games, axes (and maybe swords) would gradually replace them as the premier city raiders anyway. As enemy cities accumulate more defensive ratings, those spears become more and more costly to dislodge with War Chariots alone. The loss in mobility that would result from this handing over is usually nothing to worry about, since it corresponds roughly to the time when you need to expand at a slower pace until you can get upkeep costs down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Speaking of upkeep, be wary of over-expanding with War Chariots. It's easy to fall into this trap since they pack a good punch so early in the game. While judicious use of them might mean smooth sailing for the rest of the game, their careless use can ruin you as you fall hopelessly behind in terms of technology and development paying upkeep, especially on the higher levels. This and the lack of close neighbours are the greatest early adversaries of the Egyptian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]England: Redcoat (Rifleman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The terror of your enemies in Civ4 vanilla, this unit is dramatically different in Warlords. In the former, it has 16 strength compared to the normal rifleman's 14 and an additional 25% bonus vs. gunpowder units. Hence, they are uber powerful in their era, quite unmatched by any other unit until infantry. The use of the Redcoat on vanilla is, therefore, quite straightforward. Build lots of them and/or upgrade your CR units to them and go on the offensive. Combine them with cannons for even greater effect and watch the colours on the minimap change rapidly. Even grenadiers are unable to counter them effectively due to their additional bonus. The only way the enemy can really fight back is by throwing lots of cannons at them, but you can always spread your stacks out, and the AI isn't likely to do that anyway. Don't let the enemy get machine guns, though. These are a sure counter to Redcoats on the defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, however, it's not so easy. Redcoats have the same base strength as normal riflemen. They only retain their bonus vs. gunpowder units. That said, they are still quite effective. Given no terrain or promotion-based bonuses, no unit of the same era can beat them when they attack. They are vulnerable to attacks by enemy grenadiers now, but still not as badly as in the case of normal riflemen. They own any other unit when defending. You can still use this UU the same way, but more careful planning is required. A proper defense against enemy grenadiers must now be provided for, and cannons play a greater role. Do note that Redcoats have no advantage over normal rifles when attacking cities defended by longbows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, you must consider the Churchill factor as well. The new English leader is Charismatic and Protective, making his gunpowder units especially effective. They start with City Garrison I and Drill I and require fewer xp points get promoted. As city defenders, Churchill's Redcoats are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are also better on the offensive, since Drill helps in any combat situation and, thanks to the free City Garrison, you can better defend newly captured cities against enemy counterattacks. Some players even consider Churchill part of the reason why Redcoats had to be nerfed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A final point on this UU: Drill IV Redcoats are formidable. They get a total of 5 first strikes and a chance at another (immunity from first strikes are rare enough post-Gunpowder), an extra 10% bonus vs. mounted units and an amazing 60% reduction of any collateral damage sustained. These units are likely to take less damage in every way and win more often. And, in Warlords, Drill counts as a prerequisite promotion towards Cover, Formation and other "vs unit type" promotions. Hence, units with Drill are not condemned by not choosing Combat, should the need for those promotions arise. Especially valuable is the availability of Pinch as a promotion, since it helps to neutralise the threat of attacking grenadiers. The trouble is gunpowder (and melee) units don't get Drill promotions, so it's only possible to create such units by upgrading your archery units to Redcoats, which requires you to set aside a tidy sum. To make matters worse, archery units are generally not used offensively and are thus difficult to promote. However, the good news is Churchill players can do this more easily. With the Protective trait giving free Drill I to your archery units and Charismatic making promotions easier to obtain, you can use crossbows (the most likely candidate, since it has greater offensive value compared to archers and longbows) extensively in the hopes of getting some of them up to Drill IV to be upgraded later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Redcoat has indirectly been improved from its Warlords version since all gunpowder units can now receive Drill promotions. That means elite Drill Redcoats are much closer to reality, especially for Churchill. Gone are the days when you have to upgrade archery units to get them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ethiopia: Oromo Warrior (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Musket UUs generally don't get a lot of love, although the ones that the game has to offer are actually quite useful. But even if you're really not a fan of musket UUs, give the Oromo Warrior a try before you knock it. It is immune to First Strikes and starts with Drill I and II promotions; that means 2-3 First Strikes and -20% to collateral damage received out of the box. And if you throw the experience from barracks in, you get Drill III Oromo Warriors straight off the assembly line. Just add in Theocracy/Vassalage or a military instructor and you can be training Drill IV Oromos. Naturally, this UU has a potentially high survival rate, even after being battered by siege weapons (thanks to the Drill promotions' protection against collateral damage of up to 60%). They will perform normal muskets' defensive role extra well, and you need not be so hesitant about using them to attack even when faced with knights. Longbows are also less of a worry since Oromos are immune to First Strikes. Moreover, they are draftable, and you can get Drill III draftees with just Theocracy/Vassalage/a military instructor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If those aren't enough, you needn't worry so much about this musket UU getting obsolete quickly (BTS has delayed the advent of grenadiers to prolong the life of muskets anyway) because the promotions will remain on them when they are upgraded to riflemen. You might have read about the elusive elite Drill IV Redcoats. Well, with Ethiopia, Drill IV riflemen are a lot easier to come by. Suddenly those enemy cannons are not so scary anymore, are they?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]France: Musketeer (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they are 1 strength point weaker than knights, musketmen have no hard counter in their time, which is the whole point of this unit. Also, knights don't get defensive bonuses so they are not as good at defending. Musketmen fare well as an all-round stack protector. And when one of your cities is threatened, wouldn't it be ideal to have a versatile defender that can counterattack as well? Remember that musketmen can be drafted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, think of the potential uses of Musketeers, which are musketmen with 2 moves. They can reinforce any threatened city quickly, which makes them potentially more effective as city defenders than longbowmen. And when you need stack protection during a campaign, Musketeers, besides being an insurance that covers you against everything except knights and Pinch elephants (both of which you can simply counter by bringing pikes), are also able to pillage along the way with the extra move (which can be useful for taking out strategic resources). Not just that, their speed means you can have reserves catching up with your stack to take over the role of their wounded comrades should your stack come under attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Offensively, they have their uses as well. Musketeers can do clean-up work when all your siege weapons and CR units have spent their move attacking, since they have 9 base strength and aren't countered by any particular unit. And, of course, they are great for a pillaging campaign. Mix them with pikemen in small stacks and they can move and pillage within a single turn and with near impunity. Versatility is the name of the Musketeer game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A major gripe that people have about this UU is the fact that it obsoletes too quickly, since Chemistry is effectively only a few techs away. Moreover, nothing upgrades to muskets and you have to build them from scratch, further narrowing their window of opportunity. The Musketeers' speed actually helps to alleviate this problem, since you can get them to the frontline to be used a lot more quickly compared to normal musketmen. Also, researching Nationalism and switching to Nationhood to draft can help you get enough of them out in time to be used to full effect. You can stay in Nationhood and research towards Rifling next, so that you can soon start drafting riflemen to complete your offensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this note, there's another interesting use for Musketeers. Try postponing Chemistry and beelining to Military Tradition for early cavalry. Research techs along the Education route, be the first to get Liberalism and grab Nationalism as the free tech. Then research Gunpowder (which is also needed for cavalry), start drafting/building Musketeers (you may use them first if you want), research Military Tradition (requires Music, which you should trade for) and start building cavalry. Escort your cavalry with Musketeers and either launch a lightning campaign or pillage with impunity. Only Musketeers can keep up with cavalry while protecting them against costly counterattacks by enemy pikes. Flanking cavalry often prevail against longbow-defended cities by themselves with relatively low casualty rates, so even if you plan on taking cities, there might not be a need to bring slow siege weapons along. If you do this right, you can finish off one or two neighbours just like that, before they can build riflemen to counter your cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Germany: Panzer (Tank)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite being the latest UU in the game, the Panzer really packs a punch. A tank with 50% bonus versus armour units, it will eat other tanks alive and beat even modern armour. This gives them the power to dominate the battlefield. Just watch out for those gunships, which are an effective counter to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you get Panzers before the enemy gets Flight, you can solve this problem by beelining for enemy oil wells and pillaging them to prevent him/her from building a single gunship in the first place. This should be relatively easy to do, since the enemy can't stop you with his/her own tanks. Once that is done, you'd be facing mostly gunpowder units, against which the Pinch promotion would be effective in the field. With it, the Panzer can match even mech infantry, unless the latter is better promoted or is receiving defensive bonuses. And with the free Blitz promotion that tanks have, a stack of Panzers can annihilate up to double the number units in a turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When taking cities, the Panzer might only be as effective as a normal tank, since you are likely to face many gunpowder units, which receive defensive bonuses unlike armour units. But that is alright, since tanks are excellent at taking cities anyway, having access to both Barrage and City Raider promotions. After you've chewed through the toughest defenders, whatever armour is sitting in the city would be easy pickings. Apply the blitzkrieg strategy by using your bombers to soften city defenses before rapidly moving in with your City Raider Panzers. Be sure to have some Drill Panzers to clean up, since they are good at taking out the weaker units without suffering much damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem with this UU is how late it appears. It is enabled by Industrialism but requires oil, which means you have to get Combustion and build oil wells in addition to it, placing it even later in the timeline than Navy SEALs. Many players would have won the game by then, or at least they would be in such dominant or winning positions that having Panzers would have little influence on the outcome. Once you get them, however, they can last till the end of the game. Their ability to stand up to modern armour means you can delay getting Composites and survive without aluminum. Even if modern armour is already available, you would probably want to leave some of your Panzers un-upgraded as a versatile counter to enemy armour. Of course, you must have oil to build Panzers in the first place. Being German and not having oil in the later eras in a tightly contested game would be a shame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greece: Phalanx (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx, derided by some, is in fact one of the stronger UUs in the game. With 5 strength and +25% hill defense (not to be confused with free Guerilla promotion), it has enough qualities to set it far above normal spearmen. Don't forget that it also gets free Combat I from Alexander's Aggressive trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx is essentially a super spearman. However, if you build them early enough in single player, chances are the AI might not have anything except archers. Thus, it would do just as well as the axeman when used as a rush unit, except that it holds the ground better on hills and isn't afraid of Warlords' chariots (which get +100% attack vs. axemen). The fact that the Greeks start with Hunting (which is required to build the UU) certainly helps if you are thinking of rushing with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In its conventional role, the Phalanx also boasts a very long lifespan of more than two eras. Elephants give normal spearmen cause to worry, while knights are too strong be countered well by them. Phalangites, however, are able to counter elephants effectively and hold their own against knights. When they are defending on hills, no mounted unit before cavalry can beat them one-on-one without having at least the Shock promotion (perhaps with the exception of the melee-busting Conquistadors). They are also good at defending on hills, especially in hill cities, against most units in the Ancient and Classical eras. A truly solid package for a UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Phalanx has, for better or worse, been changed in BTS. It is now an axeman that is not vulnerable to chariots. That means chariots do not get a 100% bonus when attacking them. This effectively transforms a defensive UU into an offensive one, as Greek players need not worry about having to protect their earliest city raiding units from chariots. If you are the kind of player who says the glass is half empty, this change at most saves you from having to build a few spearmen and to research Hunting before you begin an axe rush. But if you like to say the glass is half full, this makes a strong rush unit that is exactly like the axeman in vanilla, which can only be countered by another axeman. Indeed, saving you the effort of building spearmen can be crucial in the early game, when cities are few and hammers are scarce. It can mean a few extra Phalanxes, which might decide whether you can take and hold a (or an extra) city or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the defense, the new Phalanx also performs decently in the early game. Now you don't have to build spearmen to deal with the occasional pillaging chariot, though of course spears would be more effective. Not having to build spearmen might also mean having extra Phalanxes to defend against an enemy axe rush. You might prefer the old version of this UU, but you can't say the new one isn't useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Inca: Quechua (Warrior)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dubbed by some as one of the worst UUs when Civ4 was still new, the Quechua has gained notoriety through the Quechua rush, a strategy that might win you a Deity game even if it's far above your current skill level. How is that possible, you ask? Quechuas are cheap at 15 hammers each (cheaper than half an axeman) and they get a 100% bonus against archers, the AI's primary/only city garrison unit early in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush is simple to do. You can probably start building Quechuas in the beginning and overwhelm the nearest AI capital with numbers (provided you've located it, of course). However, it's advisable that you build a worker, barracks and another worker first. The first worker would improve food resources (for whipping), build mines and chop trees, while the second would start building a road to the nearest AI capital (which, presumably, you would have found by then) and make logistics less of a nightmare. The barracks allows your capital to grow in between the worker builds, but, more importantly, it allows you to build Quechuas with Cover. In vanilla, Huayna Capac is Aggressive and hence Quechuas get Combat I free, allowing you to promote them with Cover immediately if you've built a barracks. Even though the Inca leader is no longer Aggressive in Warlords, Quechuas still get Combat I free, so this tactic still applies. Quechuas with Cover have a much higher chance of winning against fortified archers so you don't need as many of them. You would be able to capture one AI city after another much more quickly. This method also has the benefit of allowing the AIs to settle more cities before you attack, thus giving you early game expansion possibilities without having to build your own settlers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have the workers and barracks (and have researched Mining and Bronze Working), you can start building, chopping or whipping Quechuas out. If copper is discovered within your territory, you can supplement your rush with axemen, who can gradually take over as your main city raiders, ensuring that your offensive is longer-lasting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush does have its limitations. It requires a close neighbour. Otherwise, it would take too long to get there and you would have to pay an unreasonable amount of distance upkeep if you succeed in capturing the city. Of course, you can resort to razing, but this strategy would then lose half its value. It also assumes that the AI builds archers to defend itself. On that note, you need to be playing at a high enough difficulty, where the AI can either build archers immediately or soon enough. Warriors might be too cost-effective for Quechuas to be facing, even though you can choose the Shock promotion instead of Cover. A higher difficulty level also means the AI is likely to start with a free settler or two and would thus have more cities up for grabs when you begin your rush. The AI may also conveniently choose to settle his cities towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside to this rush is the relatively high amount of unit upkeep that you have to pay early in the game. Coupled with the distance maintenance you have to pay for captured cities, your early technological development might be retarded for a while. You can, however, count on being able to catch up fairly quickly if you've nabbed an especially powerful neighbouring capital. Huayna's Financial trait can also help you recover more quickly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond this strategy, the Quechua's usefulness is quite limited. They are effective against barbarians, since those often take the form of archers, and would hence perform well under raging barbs setting. They are also better than normal warriors at worker stealing (since they survive better against archers), should you choose to be aggressive from the start even though you have no plans of capturing enemy cities yet. Besides these, it's hard to conceive of another way to exploit this UU without rushing, making it rather situational. It either shines or fades into relative oblivion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]India: Fast Worker (Worker)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Fast Worker is a worker with 3 moves (which, interestingly enough, is unmatched till gunships in the modern age). This means, with all their moves unspent, they can enter forest/jungle/hill and immediately begin improving the tile without ending their turn. However, they do end their turn if they enter a forested/jungled hill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indirectly, this means the Fast Worker is faster at doing what workers do. It does not improve tiles faster, but being able to begin earlier in many situations would translate to a lot of saved worker turns by the end of the game. By the way, yes, it is the only UU that lasts throughout the game. Their extra movement also means they are able to cover distances more quickly, allowing you to move them around your empire efficiently. This enables a much tighter worker strategy, where you can have fewer workers improving tiles in different cities according to which city would grow and work the tiles next. To put it simply, playing as India, you do not need as many workers to develop your land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To get the most out of this UU, adopt an early worker strategy (i.e. building a worker first). You'd develop much quicker than the other civs and could use this early game lead to your advantage for the rest of the game. Their 3 moves also make them excellent scouts, especially early on when revealing your surroundings quickly is crucial. Just make sure you keep them away from animals and barbs. With their speed, it shouldn't be that difficult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some players do not like the fact that it is not a military UU, but few would be able to argue against its merits. The only downside to the Fast Worker is the fact that slower game speeds diminish their advantage, since the turns saved by their extra movement would be less and less significant compared to the increased number turns needed to improve tiles. If you're playing on Quick or Normal speed, this UU is certainly amazing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Japan: Samurai (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cool factor aside, there seems to be little that is interesting about this UU at first glance. It is a regular maceman that cannot be built with copper (requiring specifically iron) and has 2 first strikes. The second thing is what gives the Samurai its power, and which has sparked considerable debate on how useful it makes this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After much testing and debate, it is generally agreed that the 2 first strikes are a great boon. They help the Samurai survive, even at lower odds, and give them an edge against archers and longbows, the primary city defenders of the day. First strikes essentially mean that the unit gets the chance to inflict damage on the enemy unit even before the combat proper begins. Both archers and longbows get 1 first strike, which help them deal with regular city attackers (i.e. units with access to City Raider promotions, such as macemen), but have this advantage cancelled out by one of the Samurai's first strikes. And the Samurai still has another first strike to use. This also applies to crossbowmen (who also get 1 first strike), making the Samurai less vulnerable to that effective anti-melee unit. And, just as importantly, this advantage also has the effect of giving Samurais a higher chance to win battles while suffering less damage. That means they are potentially able to recover faster for another attack, thereby shortening the length of the Japanese player's campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But do take note that this bonus is not the same as getting free Drill promotions (to which, by the way, macemen do not have access). It is better than merely a free Drill I, but it will not remain when you upgrade your Samurais. And beware of knights (especially Conquistadors or those with Shock promotion). They are a fast and effective counter to Samurai, since they have enough strength and ignore first strikes, so bring enough pikemen when facing a sufficiently advanced opponent who has researched Guilds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawback of the Samurai is the requirement of iron. While regular macemen can be built with copper as well, without iron, the Japanese player will be stuck without his/her UU or even regular macemen. Thankfully, this strategic resource is quite commonly available. But if you do find yourself not having one readily available, planting a city in the tundra or invading your neighbour to get it might be worth the effort before the age of the Samurai arrives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Korea: Hwacha (Catapult)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] If you like axemen, you'd love the Hwacha. It is a catapult with 50% bonus vs melee units, making it an axeman with collateral damage, bombard ability and withdrawal chance for a mere five hammers more (Normal speed). The only downside is the Hwacha doesn't receive defensive bonuses like an axeman, so you might want to use your Hwachas offensively and turn up the heat so the enemy is forced to defend in his nice cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hwacha has some interesting synergy with Wang Kon's Protective trait. Protective really shines when you have no metals and are forced to adopt a defensive position with archers in the early game. Construction represents the departure from such a stance, since you're now able to build catapults and attack. Hwachas, being super catapults, puts you in an even better position to go on the offensive, with Protective archers/longbows for support as defenders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have iron, Protective crossbows and spears/pikes are perfect companions to Hwachas. They eliminate the threat of enemy melee and mounted units and help defend new possessions while your Hwachas take down enemy defenders. You don't need axemen. A few swords to help clean up can complete your arsenal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When macemen and trebuchets come into the picture, Hwachas gradually take a back seat, but not before you can deal some serious damage to a neighbour or two. Nonetheless, a Korean player would benefit from picking up Construction as quickly as possible. Why not put this powerful weapon into use as early as you can? And Wang Kon's Financial trait can certainly help with that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Unfortunately, as it stands, the Hwacha has been weakened by the inability of siege weapons to kill units and to gain more than 1 experience point per battle. Its bonus still applies, but you can no longer rely on a stack of Hwachas to actually capture cities for you. You also need enough units to kill off all the weakened defenders. While this job can be done by almost any non-siege unit, this means hammers probably need to be diverted to other units, resulting in fewer Hwachas built. Then there's the 1xp only rule, which is worse since it means your Hwachas can no longer gain valuable additional promotions through combat, making it less effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of this UU has certainly been reduced. You can still make good use of it much in the same way as before, but remember to build more units for clean up duty and to take up the slack caused by fewer veteran Hwachas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mali: Skirmisher (Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skirmishers are archers with 4 strength and 1 extra first strike chance, effectively making Mali half a Protective civ until Feudalism comes around. With them, Malinese cities are certainly not ones to be taken easily in the early game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The normal use of Skirmishers is pretty straight forward: Defend your cities or hill improvements with them. As such, they play a rather passive role as a UU. This puts into question the rationale of going straight for Archery, even when playing Mali. First, you don't start with Hunting (required for Archery). Second, the threat of barbarian or enemy axes make axemen a better unit for defense, since they are able to counterattack and prevent your improvements from being pillaged. Lastly, Bronze Working is needed for Slavery anyway, and if you happen to find copper nearby after researching it you can soon build axes. Skirmishers can help with defense if you don't find copper around, but in that case you might want to beeline to Iron Working, so Hunting and Archery are still not the priority. But of course, in the worst case scenario where you find no metal around, Skirmishers can become quite important.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords improves Skirmishers a little by making chariots a counter to axes. Now you don't have to fear barbarian/enemy axemen if you don't have copper but have horses. Barb spearmen, if they do appear, can be countered somewhat by Skirmishers. You can thus concentrate on teching up with chariots and Skirmishers for defense, without having to beeline for the relatively expensive Iron Working. If you want to be aggressive, you can rush a neighbour with a stack of chariots and some Skirmishers. The latter can help secure newly conquered cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now for the less conventional. If you are going for a really quick rush as Mali, you can beeline to Archery from the beginning. Skirmishers don't require resources, so you can technically rush a neighbour with them Jaguar-style. Get Archery as quickly as possible, build barracks - maybe settle a second city - and start building Skirmishers. After you several of them, rush the nearest neighbour's capital. Skirmishers are better than normal archers, so with a ratio of about 3:1 in your favour, you may be able to overwhelm the defending archers. The surviving Skirmishers would then help you hold on to the conquered city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you whip to rush build Skirmishers for this tactic, becareful of the hammer overflow. You might quickly begin to whip them out for one population point each and run into serious happiness issues. If you want to try this rush, you should have a food-plenty and hilly area (i.e. a good production city site) as the site of your capital. You'll need the hammers because you'll be building most of the Skirmishers the slow way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mongolia: Keshik (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keshiks are horse archers that ignore terrain movement cost and get 1 first strike, but aren't immune to first strikes. Hence, they are extremely adept at raiding and pillaging, but aren't as good at attacking archers/longbows with Drill promotions. This has a few implications on a Mongolian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surprise is the best asset of the Keshiks. Ignoring terrain movement cost means they can traverse forests/jungles and hills as easily as flatlands. Thus, it is easy for a Mongolian player to strike across difficult terrain at the unlikeliest of places, grabbing unguarded workers and lightly-defended cities or pillaging improvements (especially on strategic resources). However, this advantage relies on the enemy's inability to counterattack immediately with spearmen or a superior force, so good intelligence would be needed to know where exactly the enemy places his spears and the bulk of his units. If you do not have this luxury, you could always send more Keshiks in case you meet spears, but be prepared to lose quite a few of them. In addition, you could pillage enemy roads to eventually cripple his ability to counterattack. However, at the end of the day, the strategic advantage you gain from your harassment must outweigh the lost hammers you spent on the dead Keshiks[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Keshiks' first strike, meanwhile, makes them better than normal horse archers at picking off non-spear units in your territory or in the enemy's. Combined with their terrain movement advantage, this makes them good empire defenders and hit-and-run units. Unfortunately, the enemy can easily counter them by having spearmen guard his units, so this might only work effectively against the AI. There's also a limitation on how good Keshiks are in fighting non-spear units compared to normal horse archers. The immunity to first strikes that normal horse archers get makes them better at fighting archery units with Drill promotions or units with Drill III/IV. The Keshiks' own first strike can only negate one of the enemy units' first strikes. To remedy this, you have to give your Keshiks Flanking II so that they get immunity to first strikes as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This, in turn, highlights the Keshik's relative weakness (compared to normal horse archers) in attacking cities defended by Drill-promoted archery units. In Warlords, this means Protective civs are better covered against attempts to take cities with Keshiks. The 10% city attack penalty that the horse archer unit-type gets in Warlords makes them even less desirable as city raiders. Thus, the only hope Mongolian player might have in using Keshiks to conquer in Warlords is to rely on speed, Flanking promotions and numbers (also applies to vanilla, but not to such a large extent).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With barracks and Ger in the city, a Keshik gets 7 xp upon being built. Unfortunately, that will still allow for only 2 initial promotions (unless you're running both Vassalage and Theocracy for a total of 11 xp), though of course your mounted units would be promoted to the next level sooner. But, at any rate, 2 initial promotions are good enough. Give most of the Keshiks Flanking I and II to give them 50% withdrawal chance each (including the natural 20%) and immunity to first strikes. Give Combat I and Medic I or Combat I and Shock (for defending against spearmen) to the rest. Have at least one Medic I Keshik and one Shock Keshik in each stack. If you get Compass early enough, you can use explorers (strength 4, ignores terrain movement cost and starts with free Guerilla I and Woodsman I) to help protect your stacks when they stop on hills or forests/jungles. 3 or 4 cities with Gers pumping out Keshiks would usually be good enough to amass a sizeable army in reasonable time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As your Keshiks attack enemy cities, some will die, some will withdraw and some will win. The medics will ensure that the withdrawing and winning Keshiks heal up more quickly. If you manage to overwhelm a prepared enemy with numbers, your speed advantage (from ignoring terrain movement cost and faster healing) will ensure that the enemy cannot fight back or resist as effectively, hastening his destruction. If the enemy is unprepared in the first place, your speed advantage will ensure his quick defeat. Note that this strategy can only work if the enemy doesn't have longbows yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You should be prepared to build courthouses and marketplaces to help you keep your winnings. But even if you're not, you can just resort to razing and pillaging for some barbaric fun. Long live the Golden Horde![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Netherlands: East Indiaman (Galleon)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Now here's an interesting UU. Although it does have some combat capability, it serves primarily as a support unit. But the East Indiaman is pretty good at it, offering an extra cargo space for a total of 4, which is quite a big leap from a normal galleon considering the fact that transports have the same capacity. If you're planning on waging war during the age of the rifle, especially against an overseas civ, or if you are planning a large-scale settling another landmass, you don't have to build quite as many ships to carry your units over. Three East Indiamen carry as much as four galleons, thereby saving you 80 hammers, which can almost make an extra frigate (90 hammers) to protect your fleet. Moreover, since they carry as many units as transports, you might not need to decommission or upgrade them till the end of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The East Indiaman also has the nifty ability to travel within rival borders without needing an open borders treaty. Have you accumulated much EPs thanks to the Financial trait? You can send your spies anywhere in the world conveniently, even directly into an unfriendly overseas civ. And the extra cargo space is useful for espionage as well, helping you keep a constant flow of spies even if many get caught.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly, the East Indiaman has 2 more strength than a normal galleon, making it tougher to sink. While it still can't beat a frigate, it can more than annihilate caravels and destroy other galleons, so you have naval superiority at Astronomy until your rivals get Chemistry and build frigates. And, should there be privateers prowling the seas, you needn't worry so much about being ambushed by them while moving units across water without escort during peacetime. This is probably a UU that you would appreciate on maps with lots of seas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ottomans: Janissary (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Janissary's advantage is a 25% boost against melee, archery and mounted units, making it a great all-round unit for its time. It is pretty much effective against all previous era units (with the big exception of siege units), so you can potentially put some serious hurt in your enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to get as much use out of Janissaries as possible, you need to look for ways to get to Gunpowder early. You might even want to make a beeline for it, either through the northern path (Maths -&gt; Currency -&gt; Priesthood? -&gt; Civil Service -&gt; Paper -&gt; Education) or the southern path (Metal Casting -&gt; Machinery &amp; Monotheism -&gt; Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guilds) in the tech tree. Different lightbulbing strategies are available (with Great Merchants for the southern path and Great Scientists for the northern one), so you don't have to self-research everything. Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do a beeline, but it's probably the best way. The point is to get to Gunpowder before your enemies are even close to it, and rapidly exploiting this opportunity gap by building, whipping and possibly drafting as many Janissaries as you can to use against them. To be able to draft, you would need to pursue the northern path and probably research Liberalism first to grab Nationalism as the free tech, before actually researching Gunpowder. It is a slight diversion, but it may be worth the delay if your empire does not have the capability to build or whip enough Janissaries in time to give you a real edge, as often is the case.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have them, Janissaries are quite a fearsome force in the medieval battlefield. They have no hard counter, so the best bet your enemies might have is to promote their units with Pinch, which requires Gunpowder in Warlords. Knights with Pinch, however, are a good counter to Jannissaries, as are regular musketmen (against whom Janissaries have no advantage whatsoever), so once your enemies have Gunpowder as well you may find your edge disappearing. If they manage to get to Chemistry, which isn't that far away, this UU is practically obsolete. Janissary stacks are actually relatively vulnerable to siege units (and the associated collateral damage) as well, since they don't get any bonuses against these. But unless you're playing MP, this shouldn't be a big problem. The AI does not generally build many catapults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also take note that Janissaries may not be the best city-taking troops you can get, since they do not have access to City Raider promotions. Needless to say, if you're relying on them as the backbone of your army, you still need to bring siege weapons along if you hope to grab some enemy territory. Given the fact that they are not actually very different from the conduct of normal campaigns of the time, Janissary campaigns might still be slow going, so don't be surprised if you don't manage to knock out more than one enemy with them, even with your best efforts (assuming you're playing on the higher levels). Hence, the emphasis is again on getting them as early as possible so as to enlarge the window of opportunity that you have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Overall, without the mobility of the Musketeer, this UU is quite situational and, to an even higher degree than the former, requires some long term planning in the early game to be put to good use. It is probably better the lower the difficulty you play on, since you would be more likely to out-tech the AIs and get to Gunpowder much earlier than them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Persia: Immortal (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It seems odd that Immortals are chariot-replacements, and you may miss the ownage days of playing as Persia with their Civ3 incarnation. Fortunately, they are still very effective in Civ4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you have horses and a neighbouring civ nearby, you know you're in for some fun. Immortals get 50% bonus vs. archery units, as well as an innate 30% withdrawal chance. No AI I've seen can resist them very early in the game. Hook up those horses quickly, build/whip out some of these creatures and head straight for the neighbour. If you managed to build barracks, you can give them Flanking I for an extra 10% withdrawal chance. If you have time to kill some barbs as well, before heading for your neighbour's cities, you can promote some with Flanking II for immunity against first strikes and a total of 60% withdrawal chance. This would give them a high survival rate against archers. Don't they sound like excellent AI city busters? What's more, they do get defensive bonuses, making them less vulnerable to counterattack and decent garrison units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If or when your enemy gets spearmen, however, Immortals lose much of their power. Even one spearman in a city you're attacking can give you a lot of trouble. You really have to count on the withdrawal chances if you want the first few Immortals to survive a direct attack on the city. In Civ4 vanilla, enemy axemen would be a problem too, since chariots don't get the 50% bonus when attacking axemen like in Warlords. To help prevent difficulties from arising, you should pillage any AI mine that you see sitting on a metal resource. If a city is on top of one, pillage the roads around it to limit spear production to that city. You would thus prolong the effectiveness of your Immortals. Until your enemy gets Feudalism, that is. If he can. Although the 50% bonus also applies when fighting longbows, the latter are too strong when defending in cities to be dislodged by Immortals alone. The same may be said of enemy crossbows. But with the help of siege weapons, Immortals can still take them down quite easily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem is when there is no neighbour near you. In that case, you can't use Immortals to their full potential. However, they are still quite handy against barbs, since the latter usually take the form of archers. In Warlords, they are also great for dispatching barb axemen. Clearly, the expansion has given this solid UU even more oomph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Rome: Praetorian (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians are a blunt instrument with which you can rule the early battlefield. Taking cities is the name of the game, and Praetorians easily destroy enemy archers defending cities (even those with some cultural defense), with odds so favorable that they'll likely not suffer losses. You may lose a few if the enemy city is on a hill and the defender has City Garrison promotions, but the odds will still favor you most of the time. You probably want to give your Praetorians City Raider (CR) promotions to help bust those cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because of their high strength, Praetorians can hold their own against axeman, their natural counter. Nevertheless, it may be best to build your own axemen or promote a few Praetorians with Combat I and Shock for stack defense. Praetorians will also prevail against mounted units of the same era, though a spearman or two will only do you good, leaving your Praetorians to focus on taking those cities. After the enemy gets longbowmen, the Praetorian is still useful, but you need to support them with catapults to remove city defenses and soften up the defenders to avoid catastrophic losses. Watch out for crossbows, though; they are very effective against Praetorians. The best way to guard against them is to pillage the enemy's iron mines before he/she can build them. The same goes for enemy Shock war elephants, in which case you should pillage his/her ivory camps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians require Iron Working and iron. A Roman player would probably want to take advantage of the Praetorian as early as possible, so beelining to Iron Working is a good call. You may want to have a settler and some workers ready to exploit any iron deposit you see as soon as the tech is researched, although there's some chance that you'd find iron within your existing borders. You should also build barracks first, so that you can give your Praetorians a promotion from the get go, whether it is CR 1 for city busting or Combat 1 for Shock later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The problem with Praetorians is the Roman player may become a victim of his own success. Because it is so easy to expand quickly with this UU, the temptation to expand beyond your limit is great. You may end up too many cities, causing your economy to crash from the upkeep. One solution is to raze cities rather than keep them, unless they are close to yours or have high value (eg. capitals, holy cities or those with wonders). This also has the effect of severely weakening or even eliminating your enemies so it is easier to actually expand when your economy is able to support it later. And, while you're doing this, do pillage the improvements around razed cities to set your enemies back even further and for extra funds. You can also help yourself by building up your infrastructure at home to support your campaigns, such as laying down lots of cottages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This UU is the main reason why it's good to play as Rome when you're new on a difficulty level. Try not to get too used to having them, though, as you might become too dependent on their strength to play with any other civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Russia: Cossack (Cavalry)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the Redcoat, the Cossack is one UU that has been changed in Warlords. In Civ IV vanilla, the Cossack has a fearsome reputation. A cavalry with 18 strength and +50% against mounted units on top of the ordinary cavalry capabilities (+50% against cannon and 30% withdrawal chance), it can beat almost every unit in its era. Even riflemen, its counter, have less strength if you don't consider promotions or defensive bonuses. Pinch-promoted Cossacks can eat them alive. Riflemen need to be one level higher (4) and get the Formation promotion to even out the playing field, though you should note that Aggressive riflemen can get Formation at level 3. Redcoats do counter Cossacks very well, but Cossacks are faster, can withdraw and aren't destroyed by machine guns and massed cannons the way Redcoats are.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you are using them in the vanilla game, consider getting them as early as possible by beelining to Education, getting Liberalism and choosing Nationalism as the free tech. Nationalism leads to Military Tradition (requires Music, so make sure you trade for it) and Education leads to Gunpowder, techs needed to build Cossacks (and you must have horses, of course). If you pull this off early enough, the rest of the game should be easy - Cossacks versus longbowmen is no contest. You can shoot for a domination victory right away. All you need to do is keep pumping out Cossacks, with the whip whenever possible, while ideally running the military civics (Vassalage and Theocracy) to give your Cossacks an even bigger edge. It's no wonder that some people consider them overpowered in vanilla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords, however, is a vastly different game for Cossack fans. On one hand, there's the introduction of the stable, which improves mounted units by giving them 2 more experience points. On the other hand, the Cossack has the same strength as normal cavalry now, only retaining their bonus against mounted units. They are basically cavalry that excel in killing other cavalry. This is a lot more useful in MP, where cavalry versus cavalry is pretty much a fair game and you need to get riflemen to gain an advantage. Having Cossacks means you already have an advantage against enemy cavalry, forcing your enemies to tech to riflemen to stand a chance on the battlefield or risk being holed up in their cities and becoming sitting targets for your cannons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In SP, however, much of the action would ideally take place at enemy cities to begin with, and in this respect the Cossack is mostly as good as normal cavalry in Warlords. It can get the 2 extra experience points from stables, but so can normal cavalry. The only time you have a real advantage against the AI is when it masses cavalry. In that case, your Cossacks would cut through the AI's army like knife through butter. Unfortunately, you would probably have to capture cities to end the war anyway. That said, Cossacks are pretty good for pillaging if you promote them with Pinch, since they would then be more difficult to counter (neither riflemen nor cavalry would work effectively against them). But, still, as you can see, what was an amazing UU has become a pretty situational one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spain: Conquistador (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this UU, the road to El Dorado can be wide and clear. It has the potential to be exploited in a game-breaking way. The reason is this: Conquistadors get 50% bonus vs. melee, which gives it an advantage against the most common counter to knights - pikemen. They also get defensive bonuses, which means they can exploit the terrain to make counterattack difficult. To top all of this off, Conquistadors benefit from 2 first strikes (which normal knights don't get), making them even harder to defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need horse and iron to produce this UU. Playing as Spain, I'd make sure I get those by the time Conquistadors can be built. The Spanish player would also do well to research Guilds early, extending the life and usefulness of the UU. Conquistadors can fill the role of your main city attackers, following your siege weapons to capture city after city. They don't get CR upgrades, but they can perform decently against city defenders even when they haven't accumulated promotions. Their first strikes and immunity to first strikes certainly help, especially against longbows. And, thanks to their bonus against melee, defending pikes don't scare them that much. With defensive bonuses to help, they can also act as stack-protectors during your campaigns. Furthermore, since they have 2 moves, they can attack enemy units and come back to the stack in the same turn. If you're playing on Warlords, they make the perfect companions to Citadel-improved siege weapons. Woe to the enemy cities![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once those shiny cities have been taken, Conquistadors can help defend them until you get suitable defenders (such as longbowmen) there. This works especially well if a city is on a hill. As you can see, the versatility of the Conquistador almost matches that of the Musketeer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, here are a few words of caution. Siege weapons are not to be excluded from your Conquistador campaigns. Unless your target is still fielding archers, bringing siege units for bombardment and some collateral damage should still be part and parcel of your plans. Conquistadors are strong but not invincible. Without the proper support, they would still die to entrenched units, especially pikes and longbows. The other thing is, beware of elephants! These are the ultimate counter to Conquistadors. Under normal circumstances, there is no way a Conquistador can beat an elephant, and the latter is much cheaper to train. Just make sure you target opponents who have no ivory and you should have great time conquering with this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vikings: Berserk (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] Hate them or love them, Berserks are a popular UU. Although, not as powerful as their Civ3 incarnation, these guys can really be useful. Their 10% bonus vs. cities is certainly nice. However, for many people the problem is finding a good use for their free Amphibious promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings have a higher potential to rule on water maps than any other civ. Ragnar is Financial, which means coastal tiles produce 3 commerce instead of 2, and his UB allows his ships to move further earlier in the game by giving free Navigation promotion. Combined with the Berserk's ability to attack amphibiously with no penalty and its city attack bonus, a Viking player on a water map can fast tech to Civil Service and Machinery and have fun raiding enemy coastal cities with Berserks on fast galleys. One method to do this early is building the Oracle and grabbing Metal Casting as the free tech (which, by the way, gives access to Colossus for a further boost to those coastal tiles). Then build/whip a forge and run an engineer in a city without the Oracle. Research your way to Code of Laws and Civil Service a.s.a.p. (in the pre-patch version you can use a prophet generated by the Oracle to lightbulb CoL/CS by not researching Masonry). In the meantime, build several galleys to prepare for your sea adventures. You'll get a Great Engineer as your 1st or 2nd Great Person from the forge city. Use him to lightbulb Machinery and start building Berserks. You could also put your research slider at 0% for a few turns and upgrade some axes to Berserks (being Financial helps with accumulating money for that). If you catch your opponents without longbows yet, you've done really well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are limitations to your Berserks' ability to raid cities from the sea, though. If a city is defended by longbows, on a hill, has high cultural defense and/or walls, it could be difficult to take and might render an attempt not worth the cost. To attack such a city, you probably need to bring siege units along as galleys/triremes are not able to even bombard the city's defenses. Having to land siege units to bombard/deal collateral damage nullifies the Berserks' amphibious advantage. As such, you would need to look for softer targets to strike at. You don't have to keep the city. Find a weak spot (a lightly defended coastal city), raid, raze and pop back into the galleys before the enemy can counterattack. Landing a spear with the Berserker that has to land on that turn would help the latter survive a counterattack by mounted units (the most likely reaction you'll get from an AI). But becareful not to attack too close to an AI capital. AIs tend to stack more units in their capitals and can easily counterattack with a stronger force from there. Humans in MP will be wary of a sea attack, so watch out for axes/xbows in or within reach of coastal cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even if you're not playing on a water map, Berserks present some interesting options. With them, you have the advantage when laying siege to a city across a river if the enemy doesn't have Engineering. His non-mounted units cannot counter attack from the city without suffering a 20% penalty for attacking across the river. With their free Amphibious promotion, Berserks get no such penalty attacking the city. The only downside is your siege units do suffer from the penalty if you want to cause some collateral damage first. Conversely, this idea works in defense as well. When enemy units are across a river beside one of your cities, you can attack them with your Berserks with no penalty while they would suffer it when they attack. At the very least, Berserks always get their 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the most valuable thing about the Berserk is the fact that he keeps the Amphibious promotion when upgraded. This allows a Viking player to build Berserks (especially City Raider ones) and upgrade them later on to grenadiers or riflemen with free Amphibious. Frigates are able to bombard city defenses, so you can get yourself an elite amphibious attack force long before marines make their appearance. The free Amphibious also works the opposite way, allowing your older units to benefit from it when upgraded to Berserks. Hence, it makes sense to do so with all of your more experienced axemen or swordsmen. It would almost certainly be worth the money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Zulus: Impi (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] On the surface, the Impi may not appear to be a stellar UU, since it does not come with extra strength or with obviously strong bonuses. However, the tactical value of this unit is considerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Impi comes with the Mobility promotion (-1 movement cost to enter tiles that would normally cost 2 moves or more) and 2 moves. Thus, they have the ability to rapidly cross territory and catch another nation with a weakly defended city in the early game, when borders are not really expanded and cultural defenses are not high. They can be two tiles from a city and attack it on the same turn that war is declared. Thanks to Aggressive, they also start with Combat I, making them a little stronger. Furthermore, they are eligible for City Raider promotions, which would help crack the defenses of those early cities. Their relatively low cost, meanwhile, helps you amass a number of them as quickly as possible and simply bum rush a close neighbour.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They also make excellent pillagers. With the 100% bonus against mounted that spears get, the only units that can really catch them are not able to kill them effectively. Naturally, they can be put in your stacks or cities to defend and make counterattacks against mounted units. In your own territory, no enemy horse can hope to outrun them, so it's death to the common enemy pillagers![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An interesting gambit you can try is attaching a Great General to an Impi and giving him the Morale promotion, thus creating a 3-move unit with reduced terrain movement cost. If you manage to get it beyond Combat IV, you can add Commando to the collection. It's not going to be a particularly strong unit, but it might have some interesting tactical uses (such as running into a weakly defended part of an enemy empire to killl a worker and then getting out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, Impis have good synergy with the Zulu UB, the Ikhanda, which is a barrack that also acts as a mini courthouse (-20% maintenance cost for the city). Grab some cities from an unsuspecting opponent as outlined above and rush build Ikhandas in them to help pay for the early extra maintenance. Moreover, being Aggressive, Shaka builds his UB at double production speed, so it's more power to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zulus start conveniently with Hunting, which is required to build their UU, but Impis need copper or iron to be built. If you want to use them as an early attack unit, you must beeline to BW and find copper. If there's no copper around, well, then there's no hope for an Impi rush. The other downside to them is the fact that Mobility becomes useless when you upgrade them, unless you continue doing so all the way till they become mech infantry. No matter what, unroaded terrain would cost at least 1 movement point to enter and, except for mech infantry much later, the Impi's line of units only has 1 move each.</French>
		<German>[H1]A Comprehensive Unique Unit Guide[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]aelf[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the War Academy teaches specific strategies involving extensive use of the prominent UUs, there isn't a guide to explain the uses of the others. Strong ones like the Praetorian often need no introduction, but many players are not exposed to the possibilities that the more subtle ones present. What spurred me to start this guide are the fairly common disparaging comments about some UUs, comments that are often simply one-sided.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this guide would help you leverage the different UUs effectively or at least inspire you to be more creative with them. Give all of them a chance! But please note that this guide is written mainly for single player games. Some tips may still be useful for multiplayer, but I can't promise that. This guide also assumes that you are playing as leaders under the normal civs, which might not be true if you are playing BTS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks to [BOLD]Robo Kai, kniteowl, Cabert, Wodan, johnny_rico, gusi, UncleJJ, Bjorn190, dime, s.c.dude, drkodos, kristopherb, Elandal, Thyrwyn, Phrederick, Polycrates, Thedrin, agc28, PraetorianSteve, svv, carl corey, Andrei_V, Mr. Civtastic, Thomas G., GeneralGab, Percy, r_rolo1, facistal, jason77024, GoliathFF8[\BOLD] and [BOLD]InvisibleStalke[\BOLD] for ideas and contributions that helped make this guide possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now I shall begin. The different UUs are listed under their civs, in alphabetical order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]----------[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]America: Navy SEAL (Marine)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you've gotten over the fact that it comes very late in the game, you might realise that the Navy SEAL is actually good UU. A marine replacement, it might seem to be a niche unit. After all, how often do you conduct amphibious attacks (which include those across a river, by the way)? But take a closer look at its unique advantages and you'll realise the potential it has.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its first strike and first strike chances are not to be taken lightly. First strikes can help you deal more damage to the enemy and comfortably win battles that you might otherwise take heavy damage in or even lose. The free March promotion, meanwhile, allows the Navy SEAL to heal on the go, reducing the time it takes to recover before heading off to another battle. Bringing a Medic III unit along with your SEALs means that as soon as they have attacked, they are eligible for the 30% healing the next turn (5% from enemy territory and 25% from Medic III). So as long as they are at or above 16.8/24 strength, they will be back to full health the next turn. They can also heal right after making an amphibious assault aboard a Medic transport. The SEALs in Civ4 are indeed an elite task force worthy of their name, capable of enduring and sustaining a long campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 50% attack bonuses against machine guns and artillery are a thick layer of icing on the cake. With SEALs, you don't have to fret when attacking cities defended by machine guns (which are immune to collateral damage) without tanks. Their first strikes also help by negating the machine gun's first strikes. And, also due to their first strikes, SEALs are probably the best stack protectors against enemy artillery attacks. Divide your stack(s) into smaller SEAL-protected groups and you don't have to worry too much about getting overwhelmed by mass artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you have some coastal cities to assault or a land campaign to conduct, Navy SEALs are an excellent unit to bring along with your invasion force. They do come late, but they come at the right time if you're planning on a late domination push that would win you the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Arabia: Camel Archer (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camel Archers are knights that have a higher withdrawal chance (25%) and don't require horses or iron. You could simply use them like normal knights, but the thing about them is Flanking promotions make them very good at surviving failed attacks (+55% withdrawal chance with Flanking II). This means you don't have to balk so much at attacking a city or a stack that has a defending pike, making them more reliable as an attack unit. Of course, if you end up with no horses or iron, they give you the option of building knights in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you're playing on Warlords, stables can give your Camel Archers enough experience points to start off with Flanking I and II, so you don't have to be running Vassalage or Theocracy. Also, you can improve their ability even further by attaching Great Generals to them as warlords. Give a Flanking II Camel Archer the Tactics promotion (+30% withdrawal chance) and it would have 85% chance of retreating from a failed attack. Of course, you might still get unlucky and lose it, especially if you attack at very low odds. It's not 100% withdrawal chance, you know.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Aztecs: Jaguar Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional whipping boys, these guys get 2 free promotions in Warlords, Woodsman I and Combat I (the latter thanks to Montezuma's Aggressive trait). If you've built those cheap barracks, giving them Woodsman II immediately would allow you to rush a relatively cheap stack of them (Jaguars cost less than normal swordsmen) to enemy cities through forests and jungles, in which they have two moves. Of course, this comes at the price of not being able to give them the City Raider promotion first, but depending on how fortified the target cities are, this may not be such a problem. Jaguars do get the swordsman's inherent 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a more conventional level, the benefit of the Jaguar is probably similar to that of the Gallic Warrior - better stack protection when standing on a particular terrain. Jaguars can even defend against axemen when positioned in forests and jungles, as they get 70% terrain defense bonus there (+50% from the terrain and +20% from Woodsman I), making them good all-round defenders in this situation. Give them Woodsman II or Shock (both available immediately with barracks) and they would have no need to be afraid of axemen as long as they have trees to cover them. Hence, if the enemy's lands sport plenty of foliage, you may want to bring a few of them along in any case. Note that this applies only to [BOLD]jungles[\BOLD] in Civ4 vanilla, where Jaguars get 75% defense bonus (+50% from the terrain and +25% [BOLD]jungle[\BOLD] defense bonus).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jaguars don't require any resource so you can start building them even before hooking up copper or iron. You can also whip them out (probably with unhappy citizens) in newly conquered cities that are not connected to any metal resource, immediately creating some units for either garrison or further offensive purposes and thus helping you proceed with your campaign without having to wait for reinforcements. The value of this UU greatly increases when you find yourself without copper and iron in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More on the no resource requirement, Jaguars are a sure way to rush a neighbour early in the game. You can plant your second city on the best production site in the direction of your target without waiting for copper or iron to be revealed. Then you build barracks and granary, research IW and start whipping Jaguars out without even having to bother with any resources. Get a stack of them and attack Aztec-style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] With the addition of the Woodsman III promotion, Jaguars have become much more useful in an interesting way. Woodsman III grants 2 first strikes, +50% forest and jungle attack and the ability to heal units on the same tile at the rate of 15% per turn. Since Jaguars get Woodsman I for free and barracks can give them Woodsman II off the bat, they are effectively 2 XP away from becoming the ultimate forest/jungle warriors of their time and effective medics. If you need to take out some enemy units that are fortified in a forest/jungle, especially those that are there to choke your cities, unleash the Woodsman III Jaguars. If you need some quick healing, you have Woodsman III Jaguars. A very handy support unit to have around for early warfare. They are probably still not such effective combat units on their own, but the first strikes might help.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can even maximise the Jaguar's healing ability by attaching a Great General to it and giving it all three Medic promotions as well. Woodsman III's healing stacks with the Medic promotions (provided they are on the same unit), giving you a whooping 50% healing rate. And this isn't difficult to achieve since Jaguars get free Combat I (required for Medic I) thanks to Aggressive, so you only need 26 XP to get there. Attaching a Great General to a unit gives you 20 XP, so that Jaguar effectively only needs 6 XP, the first 3 of which can be given by barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthage: Numidian Cavalry (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] This is a UU that people are divided about. Some regard it as a good UU (though not great). Others think it is weak. The latter opinion can usually be attributed to the traditional aversion to horse archers, Horseback Riding (HBR) and Archery (techs required to build horse archer-type units). Horse archers have two moves and are good for busting archer-defended cities, but they die to spearmen, rendering them easy to counter. Archery is widely viewed as a useless dead end tech early on, while HBR is fairly expensive, making it tempting to research other more beneficial techs first. The latter's beaker cost also makes it difficult to ensure that your opponents don't have spears yet by the time it's researched. Add the fact that horse archers suffer from a 10% penalty when attacking cities in Warlords, and that the Numidian Cavalry is 1 strength weaker than normal horse archers, it's easy to turn your back on the Carthaginian UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if you consider it carefully, you may find that it's actually worth something depending on the situation. In Warlords, HBR allows you to build stables (+2 exp to mounted units), which would give your horses an edge in promotions before Vassalage/Theocracy, making the tech more attractive to research early. And the Numidian Cavalry starts with Flanking I, so, with stables, you can give them Flanking II and another promotion (eg. Mobility) right off the bat. This would give them a 50% (20% natural ability + 30% from Flanking I and II) chance to withdraw from losing battles and, if you choose Mobility, the ability to more very quickly even in enemy territory. With the Charismatic trait, it's easy to get your Numidian Cavalry to the next level for yet another promotion. Don't forget that the free Flanking I would not disappear when you upgrade them to knights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those are not all. The Numidian Cavalry also gets 50% bonus vs. melee, as well as the 50% bonus vs. siege that horse archers have, making it virtually an improved axeman. It has no need to be overly afraid of spearmen, thanks to the melee bonus. And you can rely on Flanking II to increase the survival rate of your Numidian Cavalry when up against spears, or you can even the odds with Combat I and Shock. If there's no heavy cultural defense, Numidian Cavalry can do a decent job busting cities on their own, although you'll need a good number of them. As active empire defenders or counter units, they are versatile enough, having bonuses against two categories of units. As pillagers, they are excellent since spears, the easiest counter, are not as effective against them - just be sure to build stables and give them Combat I and Shock (of course, you may want a few Sentries). It may seem like a waste of their free Flanking I, but this way the enemy cannot easily drive your pillaging Numidians out. The few Flanking-promoted ones can attack enemy units guarding key resources. Remember to pillage ivory and horses first, since elephants and horse archers are the most effective counters to your UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cons of the Numidian Cavalry are their reduced strength, the 10% penalty against cities and the fact that they can't get City Raider promotions. Once there's significant cultural defense in an enemy city, expect to take huge losses if you don't bring siege weapons along. Even if there's no cultural defense and the city is not on a hill, Numidian Cavalry are actually not as strong as the city's unpromoted fortified archers, so you need to bring at least twice as many. You can beeline to HBR and rush a neighbour with a moderate stack of them to quickly capture a few cities, but don't expect them to carve out a large empire for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Horse archers no longer get the 10% city attack penalty, so the Numidian Archer is slightly stronger now. It also gains mounted units' flanking attack ability (not to be confused with Flanking promotion), whereby it does 'collateral damage' to siege units in the stack it is attacking, making it better at countering mass catapults than before. These changes certainly mean that Carthage players have something to cheer about.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Celtia: Gallic Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Gallic Warrior is a much-maligned UU. Most people wonder why an offensive unit is given a promotion for hill defense. How on earth is that going to help him attack cities, which is what it does best?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attacking a city is the culmination of an offensive movement, which begins with your entering enemy territory. If you're careful, you would want to move your stack along the safest route to the target city as far as possible, which often means favouring forests and hills over flatlands. This is where the Gallic Warrior's free Guerilla I can help. While spearmen protect your stack against mounted units and axemen/crossbows protect it from melee units, a Gallic Warrior on a hill is the best defender against counterattacking catapults and can even take over the role of the other stack-protection units. For example, if your spearman is badly injured, the Gallic Warrior can defend against chariots or horse archers as long as you're on a hill. Thus, while normal swordsmen may be badly injured before reaching the target city in these circumstances, chances are Gallic Warriors would be in better shape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And note that Gallic Warriors can be promoted with Guerilla II and III. Such units can be a thorn in your enemy's side, running through the hills pillaging mines and maybe raiding a weakly defended city or two, thanks to Guerilla III's movement bonus on hills. The 25% bonus for attacks on hills and 30% withdrawal chance that this promotion gives also make it easier for you to deal with stubborn hill cities. And now that you can build Gallic Warriors with copper in the latest versions of Warlords, this UU can make an extra early appearance for city-busting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another neat thing about this UU is the fact that you can upgrade it to more advanced units in its line without losing the free Guerilla I. So, in effect, the benefit of this UU lasts for a long time. Remember that forests can be chopped but hills are permanent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Somewhat like the Jaguar, this UU benefits from an improvement to its natural promotion branch: the change to Guerrilla III. It still gives +25% hills attack but now it gives a 50% withdrawal chance, making a Guerilla III Gallic Warrior a very effective crack troop. Need to attack that fortified hilltop city before Construction? Guerilla III Gallic Warriors can soften the defenses and have a good chance of surviving even after losing. The 50% withdrawal chance really is quite amazing, outclassing both the Flanking promotions combined. Moreover, since both Celt leaders are Charismatic, it's really easy to get to Guerrilla III. With barracks, your Gallic Warriors can start with Guerilla II and you are only 1XP away from Guerilla III. Sounds like fun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]China: Chukonu (Crossbowman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu has a fearsome reputation. Collateral damage is something well-loved by most Civ4 players, and a respectable non-siege ground unit that has the ability to inflict it would surely become the favourite of some. The biggest weakness of siege units is their inability to defend effectively. The Chukonu, however, can function as an improved crossbowman, thus having an important benefit of siege units without the drawback.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may find it hard to pinpoint the exact role of this UU, though. Crossbows are primarily a counter unit, designed to help eliminate the threat of enemy melee units, and can in turn be countered by mounted units. If the enemy builds stacks of melee, your Chukonus will tear them apart with their bonus vs melee, first strikes and collateral damage. If the enemy mixes his stacks with mounted units, Chukonus are less effective. Thanks to collateral damage and the extra first strikes, however, they are much less helpless than normal crossbows and are still able to attack such mixed stacks, although you would probably sustain losses initially. The idea is to wear the enemy units down with your extra hits and collateral damage. Given enough Chukonus, there's almost nothing you can't defeat in the field (assuming you are facing units of the same era). But the question arises: Are they more cost effective for this purpose than catapults, since the latter are cheaper? If the enemy only has melee units then the answer is clearly yes. If the enemy has mounted units (which may be immune to first strikes) in his stack, sending in a few scuicide catapults first would probably be a better idea. The Chukonus can do semi-cleanup, dealing even more collateral damage to the enemy units and making them extremely weak and easy for more Chukonus or other units to take out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can apply the same concept when attacking a city. Siege units are still needed to remove the city's defenses, but who does the first few assaults would depend on what sort of units are defending the city. If they are macemen and pikemen/spearmen, use your Chukonus. If there are archery/mounted units in the city, use the siege units first, followed by the Chukonus and finally the cleanup crew (if you have any). Remember, Chukonus don't get City Raider promotions, so be prepared to lose some as they attack at lower odds than your CR units might have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu's first strikes are useful on the offense, but they become the primary advantage on the defense. When Chukonus are defending, they won't get to inflict any collateral damage on the enemy units, but their first strikes would be a great boost. First strikes grant chances of hitting the enemy unit before the combat proper even begins, thus improving your odds. The stronger your unit is compared to the enemy's the better first strikes are, since the hits you score would do more damage, thus increasing the possibility of your unit winning without taking much damage. This makes them even better a defense against enemy melee units than normal crossbows. Their first strikes also work well when defending against siege weapons, since they might be able to win before much collateral damage is suffered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you give your Chukonus Drill promotions for more first strikes is up to you. Note that this UU has higher chances of being promoted than normal crossbowmen, since they are more suitable for an offensive role, making it possible to accumulate quite a few Drill promotions and a lot first strikes. Moreover, if you're playing on Warlords, both Chinese leaders are Protective, so Chukonus start with Drill I, giving you a headstart in that line of promotions. Gunpowder units can't choose Drill, so upgraded Chukonus can be interesting. Incidentally, Protective also makes the Chukonu better at defending cities, thanks to the free City Garrison I promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a final note, here's a tip on how to get Chukonus early and really overrun your neighbours: Choose Qin Shi Huang as your leader and aim to build the Oracle to grab Metal Casting (requires Pottery and Bronze Working). The Industrious trait makes getting the Oracle viable, even without marble. Metal Casting leads to Machinery, but it also allows you to build your cheap Industrious forges. Build one asap and run an engineer specialist. When a Great Engineer is born, use him to lightbulb Machinery, giving you access to the Chinese UU very early. But do note that Machinery requires Iron Working and Chukonus need the iron resource to be built, so make sure you get this tech researched while waiting for the GE to be born. The worst scenario is finding no iron in your territory. To help prevent this situation, research Iron Working as quickly as possible to locate iron resources and claim them if necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Egypt: War Chariot (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At 5 strength, the Egyptian War Chariot is essentially an axeman on wheels with no City Raider promotions but has withdrawal chance. It is a very powerful and mobile unit that can win your game from as early as the Ancient Era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An Egyptian player who does not have copper has less to worry about. In fact, horses are much more important for him/her, making Animal Husbandry (AH) a priority. And since Egypt starts with Agriculture, which leads to AH, things are pretty much set up for you. Egypt also starts with The Wheel, which is required to build chariots and roads (to hook up those horses). What serendipity! Feel free to delay Bronze Working till you wish to use Slavery, unless it turns out that there are no horses within reasonable distance. If you discover horses nearby, get a settler there as soon as possible and hook it up. You can then begin preparing for your offensive. Chariot rushing has never been so effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the chariot rush tactic of pillaging the enemy's metal mines should still be applied, War Chariots aren't as afraid of spears as normal chariots because of their increased strength. Additionally, you can give them the Shock promotion to help deal with enemy spears that you might encounter. This would also help vanilla players who face enemy axemen, since the chariot bonus vs. axes applies only after Warlords (vanilla players are somewhat compensated by having 20% withdrawal chance instead of just 10%, though). That said, I have found Flanking promotions a generally better choice when up against spears. Even with Shock, War Chariots have lower odds of winning, so you might as well increase their survival rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little later in the game, a combination of War Chariots and axes would be good to guard against counterattacking spears, since War Chariots don't get defensive bonuses and would almost certainly lose all the time. In most games, axes (and maybe swords) would gradually replace them as the premier city raiders anyway. As enemy cities accumulate more defensive ratings, those spears become more and more costly to dislodge with War Chariots alone. The loss in mobility that would result from this handing over is usually nothing to worry about, since it corresponds roughly to the time when you need to expand at a slower pace until you can get upkeep costs down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Speaking of upkeep, be wary of over-expanding with War Chariots. It's easy to fall into this trap since they pack a good punch so early in the game. While judicious use of them might mean smooth sailing for the rest of the game, their careless use can ruin you as you fall hopelessly behind in terms of technology and development paying upkeep, especially on the higher levels. This and the lack of close neighbours are the greatest early adversaries of the Egyptian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]England: Redcoat (Rifleman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The terror of your enemies in Civ4 vanilla, this unit is dramatically different in Warlords. In the former, it has 16 strength compared to the normal rifleman's 14 and an additional 25% bonus vs. gunpowder units. Hence, they are uber powerful in their era, quite unmatched by any other unit until infantry. The use of the Redcoat on vanilla is, therefore, quite straightforward. Build lots of them and/or upgrade your CR units to them and go on the offensive. Combine them with cannons for even greater effect and watch the colours on the minimap change rapidly. Even grenadiers are unable to counter them effectively due to their additional bonus. The only way the enemy can really fight back is by throwing lots of cannons at them, but you can always spread your stacks out, and the AI isn't likely to do that anyway. Don't let the enemy get machine guns, though. These are a sure counter to Redcoats on the defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, however, it's not so easy. Redcoats have the same base strength as normal riflemen. They only retain their bonus vs. gunpowder units. That said, they are still quite effective. Given no terrain or promotion-based bonuses, no unit of the same era can beat them when they attack. They are vulnerable to attacks by enemy grenadiers now, but still not as badly as in the case of normal riflemen. They own any other unit when defending. You can still use this UU the same way, but more careful planning is required. A proper defense against enemy grenadiers must now be provided for, and cannons play a greater role. Do note that Redcoats have no advantage over normal rifles when attacking cities defended by longbows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, you must consider the Churchill factor as well. The new English leader is Charismatic and Protective, making his gunpowder units especially effective. They start with City Garrison I and Drill I and require fewer xp points get promoted. As city defenders, Churchill's Redcoats are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are also better on the offensive, since Drill helps in any combat situation and, thanks to the free City Garrison, you can better defend newly captured cities against enemy counterattacks. Some players even consider Churchill part of the reason why Redcoats had to be nerfed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A final point on this UU: Drill IV Redcoats are formidable. They get a total of 5 first strikes and a chance at another (immunity from first strikes are rare enough post-Gunpowder), an extra 10% bonus vs. mounted units and an amazing 60% reduction of any collateral damage sustained. These units are likely to take less damage in every way and win more often. And, in Warlords, Drill counts as a prerequisite promotion towards Cover, Formation and other "vs unit type" promotions. Hence, units with Drill are not condemned by not choosing Combat, should the need for those promotions arise. Especially valuable is the availability of Pinch as a promotion, since it helps to neutralise the threat of attacking grenadiers. The trouble is gunpowder (and melee) units don't get Drill promotions, so it's only possible to create such units by upgrading your archery units to Redcoats, which requires you to set aside a tidy sum. To make matters worse, archery units are generally not used offensively and are thus difficult to promote. However, the good news is Churchill players can do this more easily. With the Protective trait giving free Drill I to your archery units and Charismatic making promotions easier to obtain, you can use crossbows (the most likely candidate, since it has greater offensive value compared to archers and longbows) extensively in the hopes of getting some of them up to Drill IV to be upgraded later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Redcoat has indirectly been improved from its Warlords version since all gunpowder units can now receive Drill promotions. That means elite Drill Redcoats are much closer to reality, especially for Churchill. Gone are the days when you have to upgrade archery units to get them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ethiopia: Oromo Warrior (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Musket UUs generally don't get a lot of love, although the ones that the game has to offer are actually quite useful. But even if you're really not a fan of musket UUs, give the Oromo Warrior a try before you knock it. It is immune to First Strikes and starts with Drill I and II promotions; that means 2-3 First Strikes and -20% to collateral damage received out of the box. And if you throw the experience from barracks in, you get Drill III Oromo Warriors straight off the assembly line. Just add in Theocracy/Vassalage or a military instructor and you can be training Drill IV Oromos. Naturally, this UU has a potentially high survival rate, even after being battered by siege weapons (thanks to the Drill promotions' protection against collateral damage of up to 60%). They will perform normal muskets' defensive role extra well, and you need not be so hesitant about using them to attack even when faced with knights. Longbows are also less of a worry since Oromos are immune to First Strikes. Moreover, they are draftable, and you can get Drill III draftees with just Theocracy/Vassalage/a military instructor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If those aren't enough, you needn't worry so much about this musket UU getting obsolete quickly (BTS has delayed the advent of grenadiers to prolong the life of muskets anyway) because the promotions will remain on them when they are upgraded to riflemen. You might have read about the elusive elite Drill IV Redcoats. Well, with Ethiopia, Drill IV riflemen are a lot easier to come by. Suddenly those enemy cannons are not so scary anymore, are they?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]France: Musketeer (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they are 1 strength point weaker than knights, musketmen have no hard counter in their time, which is the whole point of this unit. Also, knights don't get defensive bonuses so they are not as good at defending. Musketmen fare well as an all-round stack protector. And when one of your cities is threatened, wouldn't it be ideal to have a versatile defender that can counterattack as well? Remember that musketmen can be drafted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, think of the potential uses of Musketeers, which are musketmen with 2 moves. They can reinforce any threatened city quickly, which makes them potentially more effective as city defenders than longbowmen. And when you need stack protection during a campaign, Musketeers, besides being an insurance that covers you against everything except knights and Pinch elephants (both of which you can simply counter by bringing pikes), are also able to pillage along the way with the extra move (which can be useful for taking out strategic resources). Not just that, their speed means you can have reserves catching up with your stack to take over the role of their wounded comrades should your stack come under attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Offensively, they have their uses as well. Musketeers can do clean-up work when all your siege weapons and CR units have spent their move attacking, since they have 9 base strength and aren't countered by any particular unit. And, of course, they are great for a pillaging campaign. Mix them with pikemen in small stacks and they can move and pillage within a single turn and with near impunity. Versatility is the name of the Musketeer game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A major gripe that people have about this UU is the fact that it obsoletes too quickly, since Chemistry is effectively only a few techs away. Moreover, nothing upgrades to muskets and you have to build them from scratch, further narrowing their window of opportunity. The Musketeers' speed actually helps to alleviate this problem, since you can get them to the frontline to be used a lot more quickly compared to normal musketmen. Also, researching Nationalism and switching to Nationhood to draft can help you get enough of them out in time to be used to full effect. You can stay in Nationhood and research towards Rifling next, so that you can soon start drafting riflemen to complete your offensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this note, there's another interesting use for Musketeers. Try postponing Chemistry and beelining to Military Tradition for early cavalry. Research techs along the Education route, be the first to get Liberalism and grab Nationalism as the free tech. Then research Gunpowder (which is also needed for cavalry), start drafting/building Musketeers (you may use them first if you want), research Military Tradition (requires Music, which you should trade for) and start building cavalry. Escort your cavalry with Musketeers and either launch a lightning campaign or pillage with impunity. Only Musketeers can keep up with cavalry while protecting them against costly counterattacks by enemy pikes. Flanking cavalry often prevail against longbow-defended cities by themselves with relatively low casualty rates, so even if you plan on taking cities, there might not be a need to bring slow siege weapons along. If you do this right, you can finish off one or two neighbours just like that, before they can build riflemen to counter your cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Germany: Panzer (Tank)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite being the latest UU in the game, the Panzer really packs a punch. A tank with 50% bonus versus armour units, it will eat other tanks alive and beat even modern armour. This gives them the power to dominate the battlefield. Just watch out for those gunships, which are an effective counter to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you get Panzers before the enemy gets Flight, you can solve this problem by beelining for enemy oil wells and pillaging them to prevent him/her from building a single gunship in the first place. This should be relatively easy to do, since the enemy can't stop you with his/her own tanks. Once that is done, you'd be facing mostly gunpowder units, against which the Pinch promotion would be effective in the field. With it, the Panzer can match even mech infantry, unless the latter is better promoted or is receiving defensive bonuses. And with the free Blitz promotion that tanks have, a stack of Panzers can annihilate up to double the number units in a turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When taking cities, the Panzer might only be as effective as a normal tank, since you are likely to face many gunpowder units, which receive defensive bonuses unlike armour units. But that is alright, since tanks are excellent at taking cities anyway, having access to both Barrage and City Raider promotions. After you've chewed through the toughest defenders, whatever armour is sitting in the city would be easy pickings. Apply the blitzkrieg strategy by using your bombers to soften city defenses before rapidly moving in with your City Raider Panzers. Be sure to have some Drill Panzers to clean up, since they are good at taking out the weaker units without suffering much damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem with this UU is how late it appears. It is enabled by Industrialism but requires oil, which means you have to get Combustion and build oil wells in addition to it, placing it even later in the timeline than Navy SEALs. Many players would have won the game by then, or at least they would be in such dominant or winning positions that having Panzers would have little influence on the outcome. Once you get them, however, they can last till the end of the game. Their ability to stand up to modern armour means you can delay getting Composites and survive without aluminum. Even if modern armour is already available, you would probably want to leave some of your Panzers un-upgraded as a versatile counter to enemy armour. Of course, you must have oil to build Panzers in the first place. Being German and not having oil in the later eras in a tightly contested game would be a shame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greece: Phalanx (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx, derided by some, is in fact one of the stronger UUs in the game. With 5 strength and +25% hill defense (not to be confused with free Guerilla promotion), it has enough qualities to set it far above normal spearmen. Don't forget that it also gets free Combat I from Alexander's Aggressive trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx is essentially a super spearman. However, if you build them early enough in single player, chances are the AI might not have anything except archers. Thus, it would do just as well as the axeman when used as a rush unit, except that it holds the ground better on hills and isn't afraid of Warlords' chariots (which get +100% attack vs. axemen). The fact that the Greeks start with Hunting (which is required to build the UU) certainly helps if you are thinking of rushing with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In its conventional role, the Phalanx also boasts a very long lifespan of more than two eras. Elephants give normal spearmen cause to worry, while knights are too strong be countered well by them. Phalangites, however, are able to counter elephants effectively and hold their own against knights. When they are defending on hills, no mounted unit before cavalry can beat them one-on-one without having at least the Shock promotion (perhaps with the exception of the melee-busting Conquistadors). They are also good at defending on hills, especially in hill cities, against most units in the Ancient and Classical eras. A truly solid package for a UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Phalanx has, for better or worse, been changed in BTS. It is now an axeman that is not vulnerable to chariots. That means chariots do not get a 100% bonus when attacking them. This effectively transforms a defensive UU into an offensive one, as Greek players need not worry about having to protect their earliest city raiding units from chariots. If you are the kind of player who says the glass is half empty, this change at most saves you from having to build a few spearmen and to research Hunting before you begin an axe rush. But if you like to say the glass is half full, this makes a strong rush unit that is exactly like the axeman in vanilla, which can only be countered by another axeman. Indeed, saving you the effort of building spearmen can be crucial in the early game, when cities are few and hammers are scarce. It can mean a few extra Phalanxes, which might decide whether you can take and hold a (or an extra) city or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the defense, the new Phalanx also performs decently in the early game. Now you don't have to build spearmen to deal with the occasional pillaging chariot, though of course spears would be more effective. Not having to build spearmen might also mean having extra Phalanxes to defend against an enemy axe rush. You might prefer the old version of this UU, but you can't say the new one isn't useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Inca: Quechua (Warrior)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dubbed by some as one of the worst UUs when Civ4 was still new, the Quechua has gained notoriety through the Quechua rush, a strategy that might win you a Deity game even if it's far above your current skill level. How is that possible, you ask? Quechuas are cheap at 15 hammers each (cheaper than half an axeman) and they get a 100% bonus against archers, the AI's primary/only city garrison unit early in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush is simple to do. You can probably start building Quechuas in the beginning and overwhelm the nearest AI capital with numbers (provided you've located it, of course). However, it's advisable that you build a worker, barracks and another worker first. The first worker would improve food resources (for whipping), build mines and chop trees, while the second would start building a road to the nearest AI capital (which, presumably, you would have found by then) and make logistics less of a nightmare. The barracks allows your capital to grow in between the worker builds, but, more importantly, it allows you to build Quechuas with Cover. In vanilla, Huayna Capac is Aggressive and hence Quechuas get Combat I free, allowing you to promote them with Cover immediately if you've built a barracks. Even though the Inca leader is no longer Aggressive in Warlords, Quechuas still get Combat I free, so this tactic still applies. Quechuas with Cover have a much higher chance of winning against fortified archers so you don't need as many of them. You would be able to capture one AI city after another much more quickly. This method also has the benefit of allowing the AIs to settle more cities before you attack, thus giving you early game expansion possibilities without having to build your own settlers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have the workers and barracks (and have researched Mining and Bronze Working), you can start building, chopping or whipping Quechuas out. If copper is discovered within your territory, you can supplement your rush with axemen, who can gradually take over as your main city raiders, ensuring that your offensive is longer-lasting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush does have its limitations. It requires a close neighbour. Otherwise, it would take too long to get there and you would have to pay an unreasonable amount of distance upkeep if you succeed in capturing the city. Of course, you can resort to razing, but this strategy would then lose half its value. It also assumes that the AI builds archers to defend itself. On that note, you need to be playing at a high enough difficulty, where the AI can either build archers immediately or soon enough. Warriors might be too cost-effective for Quechuas to be facing, even though you can choose the Shock promotion instead of Cover. A higher difficulty level also means the AI is likely to start with a free settler or two and would thus have more cities up for grabs when you begin your rush. The AI may also conveniently choose to settle his cities towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside to this rush is the relatively high amount of unit upkeep that you have to pay early in the game. Coupled with the distance maintenance you have to pay for captured cities, your early technological development might be retarded for a while. You can, however, count on being able to catch up fairly quickly if you've nabbed an especially powerful neighbouring capital. Huayna's Financial trait can also help you recover more quickly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond this strategy, the Quechua's usefulness is quite limited. They are effective against barbarians, since those often take the form of archers, and would hence perform well under raging barbs setting. They are also better than normal warriors at worker stealing (since they survive better against archers), should you choose to be aggressive from the start even though you have no plans of capturing enemy cities yet. Besides these, it's hard to conceive of another way to exploit this UU without rushing, making it rather situational. It either shines or fades into relative oblivion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]India: Fast Worker (Worker)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Fast Worker is a worker with 3 moves (which, interestingly enough, is unmatched till gunships in the modern age). This means, with all their moves unspent, they can enter forest/jungle/hill and immediately begin improving the tile without ending their turn. However, they do end their turn if they enter a forested/jungled hill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indirectly, this means the Fast Worker is faster at doing what workers do. It does not improve tiles faster, but being able to begin earlier in many situations would translate to a lot of saved worker turns by the end of the game. By the way, yes, it is the only UU that lasts throughout the game. Their extra movement also means they are able to cover distances more quickly, allowing you to move them around your empire efficiently. This enables a much tighter worker strategy, where you can have fewer workers improving tiles in different cities according to which city would grow and work the tiles next. To put it simply, playing as India, you do not need as many workers to develop your land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To get the most out of this UU, adopt an early worker strategy (i.e. building a worker first). You'd develop much quicker than the other civs and could use this early game lead to your advantage for the rest of the game. Their 3 moves also make them excellent scouts, especially early on when revealing your surroundings quickly is crucial. Just make sure you keep them away from animals and barbs. With their speed, it shouldn't be that difficult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some players do not like the fact that it is not a military UU, but few would be able to argue against its merits. The only downside to the Fast Worker is the fact that slower game speeds diminish their advantage, since the turns saved by their extra movement would be less and less significant compared to the increased number turns needed to improve tiles. If you're playing on Quick or Normal speed, this UU is certainly amazing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Japan: Samurai (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cool factor aside, there seems to be little that is interesting about this UU at first glance. It is a regular maceman that cannot be built with copper (requiring specifically iron) and has 2 first strikes. The second thing is what gives the Samurai its power, and which has sparked considerable debate on how useful it makes this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After much testing and debate, it is generally agreed that the 2 first strikes are a great boon. They help the Samurai survive, even at lower odds, and give them an edge against archers and longbows, the primary city defenders of the day. First strikes essentially mean that the unit gets the chance to inflict damage on the enemy unit even before the combat proper begins. Both archers and longbows get 1 first strike, which help them deal with regular city attackers (i.e. units with access to City Raider promotions, such as macemen), but have this advantage cancelled out by one of the Samurai's first strikes. And the Samurai still has another first strike to use. This also applies to crossbowmen (who also get 1 first strike), making the Samurai less vulnerable to that effective anti-melee unit. And, just as importantly, this advantage also has the effect of giving Samurais a higher chance to win battles while suffering less damage. That means they are potentially able to recover faster for another attack, thereby shortening the length of the Japanese player's campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But do take note that this bonus is not the same as getting free Drill promotions (to which, by the way, macemen do not have access). It is better than merely a free Drill I, but it will not remain when you upgrade your Samurais. And beware of knights (especially Conquistadors or those with Shock promotion). They are a fast and effective counter to Samurai, since they have enough strength and ignore first strikes, so bring enough pikemen when facing a sufficiently advanced opponent who has researched Guilds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawback of the Samurai is the requirement of iron. While regular macemen can be built with copper as well, without iron, the Japanese player will be stuck without his/her UU or even regular macemen. Thankfully, this strategic resource is quite commonly available. But if you do find yourself not having one readily available, planting a city in the tundra or invading your neighbour to get it might be worth the effort before the age of the Samurai arrives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Korea: Hwacha (Catapult)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] If you like axemen, you'd love the Hwacha. It is a catapult with 50% bonus vs melee units, making it an axeman with collateral damage, bombard ability and withdrawal chance for a mere five hammers more (Normal speed). The only downside is the Hwacha doesn't receive defensive bonuses like an axeman, so you might want to use your Hwachas offensively and turn up the heat so the enemy is forced to defend in his nice cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hwacha has some interesting synergy with Wang Kon's Protective trait. Protective really shines when you have no metals and are forced to adopt a defensive position with archers in the early game. Construction represents the departure from such a stance, since you're now able to build catapults and attack. Hwachas, being super catapults, puts you in an even better position to go on the offensive, with Protective archers/longbows for support as defenders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have iron, Protective crossbows and spears/pikes are perfect companions to Hwachas. They eliminate the threat of enemy melee and mounted units and help defend new possessions while your Hwachas take down enemy defenders. You don't need axemen. A few swords to help clean up can complete your arsenal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When macemen and trebuchets come into the picture, Hwachas gradually take a back seat, but not before you can deal some serious damage to a neighbour or two. Nonetheless, a Korean player would benefit from picking up Construction as quickly as possible. Why not put this powerful weapon into use as early as you can? And Wang Kon's Financial trait can certainly help with that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Unfortunately, as it stands, the Hwacha has been weakened by the inability of siege weapons to kill units and to gain more than 1 experience point per battle. Its bonus still applies, but you can no longer rely on a stack of Hwachas to actually capture cities for you. You also need enough units to kill off all the weakened defenders. While this job can be done by almost any non-siege unit, this means hammers probably need to be diverted to other units, resulting in fewer Hwachas built. Then there's the 1xp only rule, which is worse since it means your Hwachas can no longer gain valuable additional promotions through combat, making it less effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of this UU has certainly been reduced. You can still make good use of it much in the same way as before, but remember to build more units for clean up duty and to take up the slack caused by fewer veteran Hwachas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mali: Skirmisher (Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skirmishers are archers with 4 strength and 1 extra first strike chance, effectively making Mali half a Protective civ until Feudalism comes around. With them, Malinese cities are certainly not ones to be taken easily in the early game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The normal use of Skirmishers is pretty straight forward: Defend your cities or hill improvements with them. As such, they play a rather passive role as a UU. This puts into question the rationale of going straight for Archery, even when playing Mali. First, you don't start with Hunting (required for Archery). Second, the threat of barbarian or enemy axes make axemen a better unit for defense, since they are able to counterattack and prevent your improvements from being pillaged. Lastly, Bronze Working is needed for Slavery anyway, and if you happen to find copper nearby after researching it you can soon build axes. Skirmishers can help with defense if you don't find copper around, but in that case you might want to beeline to Iron Working, so Hunting and Archery are still not the priority. But of course, in the worst case scenario where you find no metal around, Skirmishers can become quite important.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords improves Skirmishers a little by making chariots a counter to axes. Now you don't have to fear barbarian/enemy axemen if you don't have copper but have horses. Barb spearmen, if they do appear, can be countered somewhat by Skirmishers. You can thus concentrate on teching up with chariots and Skirmishers for defense, without having to beeline for the relatively expensive Iron Working. If you want to be aggressive, you can rush a neighbour with a stack of chariots and some Skirmishers. The latter can help secure newly conquered cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now for the less conventional. If you are going for a really quick rush as Mali, you can beeline to Archery from the beginning. Skirmishers don't require resources, so you can technically rush a neighbour with them Jaguar-style. Get Archery as quickly as possible, build barracks - maybe settle a second city - and start building Skirmishers. After you several of them, rush the nearest neighbour's capital. Skirmishers are better than normal archers, so with a ratio of about 3:1 in your favour, you may be able to overwhelm the defending archers. The surviving Skirmishers would then help you hold on to the conquered city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you whip to rush build Skirmishers for this tactic, becareful of the hammer overflow. You might quickly begin to whip them out for one population point each and run into serious happiness issues. If you want to try this rush, you should have a food-plenty and hilly area (i.e. a good production city site) as the site of your capital. You'll need the hammers because you'll be building most of the Skirmishers the slow way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mongolia: Keshik (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keshiks are horse archers that ignore terrain movement cost and get 1 first strike, but aren't immune to first strikes. Hence, they are extremely adept at raiding and pillaging, but aren't as good at attacking archers/longbows with Drill promotions. This has a few implications on a Mongolian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surprise is the best asset of the Keshiks. Ignoring terrain movement cost means they can traverse forests/jungles and hills as easily as flatlands. Thus, it is easy for a Mongolian player to strike across difficult terrain at the unlikeliest of places, grabbing unguarded workers and lightly-defended cities or pillaging improvements (especially on strategic resources). However, this advantage relies on the enemy's inability to counterattack immediately with spearmen or a superior force, so good intelligence would be needed to know where exactly the enemy places his spears and the bulk of his units. If you do not have this luxury, you could always send more Keshiks in case you meet spears, but be prepared to lose quite a few of them. In addition, you could pillage enemy roads to eventually cripple his ability to counterattack. However, at the end of the day, the strategic advantage you gain from your harassment must outweigh the lost hammers you spent on the dead Keshiks[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Keshiks' first strike, meanwhile, makes them better than normal horse archers at picking off non-spear units in your territory or in the enemy's. Combined with their terrain movement advantage, this makes them good empire defenders and hit-and-run units. Unfortunately, the enemy can easily counter them by having spearmen guard his units, so this might only work effectively against the AI. There's also a limitation on how good Keshiks are in fighting non-spear units compared to normal horse archers. The immunity to first strikes that normal horse archers get makes them better at fighting archery units with Drill promotions or units with Drill III/IV. The Keshiks' own first strike can only negate one of the enemy units' first strikes. To remedy this, you have to give your Keshiks Flanking II so that they get immunity to first strikes as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This, in turn, highlights the Keshik's relative weakness (compared to normal horse archers) in attacking cities defended by Drill-promoted archery units. In Warlords, this means Protective civs are better covered against attempts to take cities with Keshiks. The 10% city attack penalty that the horse archer unit-type gets in Warlords makes them even less desirable as city raiders. Thus, the only hope Mongolian player might have in using Keshiks to conquer in Warlords is to rely on speed, Flanking promotions and numbers (also applies to vanilla, but not to such a large extent).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With barracks and Ger in the city, a Keshik gets 7 xp upon being built. Unfortunately, that will still allow for only 2 initial promotions (unless you're running both Vassalage and Theocracy for a total of 11 xp), though of course your mounted units would be promoted to the next level sooner. But, at any rate, 2 initial promotions are good enough. Give most of the Keshiks Flanking I and II to give them 50% withdrawal chance each (including the natural 20%) and immunity to first strikes. Give Combat I and Medic I or Combat I and Shock (for defending against spearmen) to the rest. Have at least one Medic I Keshik and one Shock Keshik in each stack. If you get Compass early enough, you can use explorers (strength 4, ignores terrain movement cost and starts with free Guerilla I and Woodsman I) to help protect your stacks when they stop on hills or forests/jungles. 3 or 4 cities with Gers pumping out Keshiks would usually be good enough to amass a sizeable army in reasonable time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As your Keshiks attack enemy cities, some will die, some will withdraw and some will win. The medics will ensure that the withdrawing and winning Keshiks heal up more quickly. If you manage to overwhelm a prepared enemy with numbers, your speed advantage (from ignoring terrain movement cost and faster healing) will ensure that the enemy cannot fight back or resist as effectively, hastening his destruction. If the enemy is unprepared in the first place, your speed advantage will ensure his quick defeat. Note that this strategy can only work if the enemy doesn't have longbows yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You should be prepared to build courthouses and marketplaces to help you keep your winnings. But even if you're not, you can just resort to razing and pillaging for some barbaric fun. Long live the Golden Horde![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Netherlands: East Indiaman (Galleon)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Now here's an interesting UU. Although it does have some combat capability, it serves primarily as a support unit. But the East Indiaman is pretty good at it, offering an extra cargo space for a total of 4, which is quite a big leap from a normal galleon considering the fact that transports have the same capacity. If you're planning on waging war during the age of the rifle, especially against an overseas civ, or if you are planning a large-scale settling another landmass, you don't have to build quite as many ships to carry your units over. Three East Indiamen carry as much as four galleons, thereby saving you 80 hammers, which can almost make an extra frigate (90 hammers) to protect your fleet. Moreover, since they carry as many units as transports, you might not need to decommission or upgrade them till the end of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The East Indiaman also has the nifty ability to travel within rival borders without needing an open borders treaty. Have you accumulated much EPs thanks to the Financial trait? You can send your spies anywhere in the world conveniently, even directly into an unfriendly overseas civ. And the extra cargo space is useful for espionage as well, helping you keep a constant flow of spies even if many get caught.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly, the East Indiaman has 2 more strength than a normal galleon, making it tougher to sink. While it still can't beat a frigate, it can more than annihilate caravels and destroy other galleons, so you have naval superiority at Astronomy until your rivals get Chemistry and build frigates. And, should there be privateers prowling the seas, you needn't worry so much about being ambushed by them while moving units across water without escort during peacetime. This is probably a UU that you would appreciate on maps with lots of seas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ottomans: Janissary (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Janissary's advantage is a 25% boost against melee, archery and mounted units, making it a great all-round unit for its time. It is pretty much effective against all previous era units (with the big exception of siege units), so you can potentially put some serious hurt in your enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to get as much use out of Janissaries as possible, you need to look for ways to get to Gunpowder early. You might even want to make a beeline for it, either through the northern path (Maths -&gt; Currency -&gt; Priesthood? -&gt; Civil Service -&gt; Paper -&gt; Education) or the southern path (Metal Casting -&gt; Machinery &amp; Monotheism -&gt; Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guilds) in the tech tree. Different lightbulbing strategies are available (with Great Merchants for the southern path and Great Scientists for the northern one), so you don't have to self-research everything. Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do a beeline, but it's probably the best way. The point is to get to Gunpowder before your enemies are even close to it, and rapidly exploiting this opportunity gap by building, whipping and possibly drafting as many Janissaries as you can to use against them. To be able to draft, you would need to pursue the northern path and probably research Liberalism first to grab Nationalism as the free tech, before actually researching Gunpowder. It is a slight diversion, but it may be worth the delay if your empire does not have the capability to build or whip enough Janissaries in time to give you a real edge, as often is the case.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have them, Janissaries are quite a fearsome force in the medieval battlefield. They have no hard counter, so the best bet your enemies might have is to promote their units with Pinch, which requires Gunpowder in Warlords. Knights with Pinch, however, are a good counter to Jannissaries, as are regular musketmen (against whom Janissaries have no advantage whatsoever), so once your enemies have Gunpowder as well you may find your edge disappearing. If they manage to get to Chemistry, which isn't that far away, this UU is practically obsolete. Janissary stacks are actually relatively vulnerable to siege units (and the associated collateral damage) as well, since they don't get any bonuses against these. But unless you're playing MP, this shouldn't be a big problem. The AI does not generally build many catapults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also take note that Janissaries may not be the best city-taking troops you can get, since they do not have access to City Raider promotions. Needless to say, if you're relying on them as the backbone of your army, you still need to bring siege weapons along if you hope to grab some enemy territory. Given the fact that they are not actually very different from the conduct of normal campaigns of the time, Janissary campaigns might still be slow going, so don't be surprised if you don't manage to knock out more than one enemy with them, even with your best efforts (assuming you're playing on the higher levels). Hence, the emphasis is again on getting them as early as possible so as to enlarge the window of opportunity that you have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Overall, without the mobility of the Musketeer, this UU is quite situational and, to an even higher degree than the former, requires some long term planning in the early game to be put to good use. It is probably better the lower the difficulty you play on, since you would be more likely to out-tech the AIs and get to Gunpowder much earlier than them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Persia: Immortal (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It seems odd that Immortals are chariot-replacements, and you may miss the ownage days of playing as Persia with their Civ3 incarnation. Fortunately, they are still very effective in Civ4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you have horses and a neighbouring civ nearby, you know you're in for some fun. Immortals get 50% bonus vs. archery units, as well as an innate 30% withdrawal chance. No AI I've seen can resist them very early in the game. Hook up those horses quickly, build/whip out some of these creatures and head straight for the neighbour. If you managed to build barracks, you can give them Flanking I for an extra 10% withdrawal chance. If you have time to kill some barbs as well, before heading for your neighbour's cities, you can promote some with Flanking II for immunity against first strikes and a total of 60% withdrawal chance. This would give them a high survival rate against archers. Don't they sound like excellent AI city busters? What's more, they do get defensive bonuses, making them less vulnerable to counterattack and decent garrison units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If or when your enemy gets spearmen, however, Immortals lose much of their power. Even one spearman in a city you're attacking can give you a lot of trouble. You really have to count on the withdrawal chances if you want the first few Immortals to survive a direct attack on the city. In Civ4 vanilla, enemy axemen would be a problem too, since chariots don't get the 50% bonus when attacking axemen like in Warlords. To help prevent difficulties from arising, you should pillage any AI mine that you see sitting on a metal resource. If a city is on top of one, pillage the roads around it to limit spear production to that city. You would thus prolong the effectiveness of your Immortals. Until your enemy gets Feudalism, that is. If he can. Although the 50% bonus also applies when fighting longbows, the latter are too strong when defending in cities to be dislodged by Immortals alone. The same may be said of enemy crossbows. But with the help of siege weapons, Immortals can still take them down quite easily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem is when there is no neighbour near you. In that case, you can't use Immortals to their full potential. However, they are still quite handy against barbs, since the latter usually take the form of archers. In Warlords, they are also great for dispatching barb axemen. Clearly, the expansion has given this solid UU even more oomph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Rome: Praetorian (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians are a blunt instrument with which you can rule the early battlefield. Taking cities is the name of the game, and Praetorians easily destroy enemy archers defending cities (even those with some cultural defense), with odds so favorable that they'll likely not suffer losses. You may lose a few if the enemy city is on a hill and the defender has City Garrison promotions, but the odds will still favor you most of the time. You probably want to give your Praetorians City Raider (CR) promotions to help bust those cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because of their high strength, Praetorians can hold their own against axeman, their natural counter. Nevertheless, it may be best to build your own axemen or promote a few Praetorians with Combat I and Shock for stack defense. Praetorians will also prevail against mounted units of the same era, though a spearman or two will only do you good, leaving your Praetorians to focus on taking those cities. After the enemy gets longbowmen, the Praetorian is still useful, but you need to support them with catapults to remove city defenses and soften up the defenders to avoid catastrophic losses. Watch out for crossbows, though; they are very effective against Praetorians. The best way to guard against them is to pillage the enemy's iron mines before he/she can build them. The same goes for enemy Shock war elephants, in which case you should pillage his/her ivory camps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians require Iron Working and iron. A Roman player would probably want to take advantage of the Praetorian as early as possible, so beelining to Iron Working is a good call. You may want to have a settler and some workers ready to exploit any iron deposit you see as soon as the tech is researched, although there's some chance that you'd find iron within your existing borders. You should also build barracks first, so that you can give your Praetorians a promotion from the get go, whether it is CR 1 for city busting or Combat 1 for Shock later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The problem with Praetorians is the Roman player may become a victim of his own success. Because it is so easy to expand quickly with this UU, the temptation to expand beyond your limit is great. You may end up too many cities, causing your economy to crash from the upkeep. One solution is to raze cities rather than keep them, unless they are close to yours or have high value (eg. capitals, holy cities or those with wonders). This also has the effect of severely weakening or even eliminating your enemies so it is easier to actually expand when your economy is able to support it later. And, while you're doing this, do pillage the improvements around razed cities to set your enemies back even further and for extra funds. You can also help yourself by building up your infrastructure at home to support your campaigns, such as laying down lots of cottages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This UU is the main reason why it's good to play as Rome when you're new on a difficulty level. Try not to get too used to having them, though, as you might become too dependent on their strength to play with any other civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Russia: Cossack (Cavalry)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the Redcoat, the Cossack is one UU that has been changed in Warlords. In Civ IV vanilla, the Cossack has a fearsome reputation. A cavalry with 18 strength and +50% against mounted units on top of the ordinary cavalry capabilities (+50% against cannon and 30% withdrawal chance), it can beat almost every unit in its era. Even riflemen, its counter, have less strength if you don't consider promotions or defensive bonuses. Pinch-promoted Cossacks can eat them alive. Riflemen need to be one level higher (4) and get the Formation promotion to even out the playing field, though you should note that Aggressive riflemen can get Formation at level 3. Redcoats do counter Cossacks very well, but Cossacks are faster, can withdraw and aren't destroyed by machine guns and massed cannons the way Redcoats are.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you are using them in the vanilla game, consider getting them as early as possible by beelining to Education, getting Liberalism and choosing Nationalism as the free tech. Nationalism leads to Military Tradition (requires Music, so make sure you trade for it) and Education leads to Gunpowder, techs needed to build Cossacks (and you must have horses, of course). If you pull this off early enough, the rest of the game should be easy - Cossacks versus longbowmen is no contest. You can shoot for a domination victory right away. All you need to do is keep pumping out Cossacks, with the whip whenever possible, while ideally running the military civics (Vassalage and Theocracy) to give your Cossacks an even bigger edge. It's no wonder that some people consider them overpowered in vanilla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords, however, is a vastly different game for Cossack fans. On one hand, there's the introduction of the stable, which improves mounted units by giving them 2 more experience points. On the other hand, the Cossack has the same strength as normal cavalry now, only retaining their bonus against mounted units. They are basically cavalry that excel in killing other cavalry. This is a lot more useful in MP, where cavalry versus cavalry is pretty much a fair game and you need to get riflemen to gain an advantage. Having Cossacks means you already have an advantage against enemy cavalry, forcing your enemies to tech to riflemen to stand a chance on the battlefield or risk being holed up in their cities and becoming sitting targets for your cannons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In SP, however, much of the action would ideally take place at enemy cities to begin with, and in this respect the Cossack is mostly as good as normal cavalry in Warlords. It can get the 2 extra experience points from stables, but so can normal cavalry. The only time you have a real advantage against the AI is when it masses cavalry. In that case, your Cossacks would cut through the AI's army like knife through butter. Unfortunately, you would probably have to capture cities to end the war anyway. That said, Cossacks are pretty good for pillaging if you promote them with Pinch, since they would then be more difficult to counter (neither riflemen nor cavalry would work effectively against them). But, still, as you can see, what was an amazing UU has become a pretty situational one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spain: Conquistador (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this UU, the road to El Dorado can be wide and clear. It has the potential to be exploited in a game-breaking way. The reason is this: Conquistadors get 50% bonus vs. melee, which gives it an advantage against the most common counter to knights - pikemen. They also get defensive bonuses, which means they can exploit the terrain to make counterattack difficult. To top all of this off, Conquistadors benefit from 2 first strikes (which normal knights don't get), making them even harder to defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need horse and iron to produce this UU. Playing as Spain, I'd make sure I get those by the time Conquistadors can be built. The Spanish player would also do well to research Guilds early, extending the life and usefulness of the UU. Conquistadors can fill the role of your main city attackers, following your siege weapons to capture city after city. They don't get CR upgrades, but they can perform decently against city defenders even when they haven't accumulated promotions. Their first strikes and immunity to first strikes certainly help, especially against longbows. And, thanks to their bonus against melee, defending pikes don't scare them that much. With defensive bonuses to help, they can also act as stack-protectors during your campaigns. Furthermore, since they have 2 moves, they can attack enemy units and come back to the stack in the same turn. If you're playing on Warlords, they make the perfect companions to Citadel-improved siege weapons. Woe to the enemy cities![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once those shiny cities have been taken, Conquistadors can help defend them until you get suitable defenders (such as longbowmen) there. This works especially well if a city is on a hill. As you can see, the versatility of the Conquistador almost matches that of the Musketeer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, here are a few words of caution. Siege weapons are not to be excluded from your Conquistador campaigns. Unless your target is still fielding archers, bringing siege units for bombardment and some collateral damage should still be part and parcel of your plans. Conquistadors are strong but not invincible. Without the proper support, they would still die to entrenched units, especially pikes and longbows. The other thing is, beware of elephants! These are the ultimate counter to Conquistadors. Under normal circumstances, there is no way a Conquistador can beat an elephant, and the latter is much cheaper to train. Just make sure you target opponents who have no ivory and you should have great time conquering with this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vikings: Berserk (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] Hate them or love them, Berserks are a popular UU. Although, not as powerful as their Civ3 incarnation, these guys can really be useful. Their 10% bonus vs. cities is certainly nice. However, for many people the problem is finding a good use for their free Amphibious promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings have a higher potential to rule on water maps than any other civ. Ragnar is Financial, which means coastal tiles produce 3 commerce instead of 2, and his UB allows his ships to move further earlier in the game by giving free Navigation promotion. Combined with the Berserk's ability to attack amphibiously with no penalty and its city attack bonus, a Viking player on a water map can fast tech to Civil Service and Machinery and have fun raiding enemy coastal cities with Berserks on fast galleys. One method to do this early is building the Oracle and grabbing Metal Casting as the free tech (which, by the way, gives access to Colossus for a further boost to those coastal tiles). Then build/whip a forge and run an engineer in a city without the Oracle. Research your way to Code of Laws and Civil Service a.s.a.p. (in the pre-patch version you can use a prophet generated by the Oracle to lightbulb CoL/CS by not researching Masonry). In the meantime, build several galleys to prepare for your sea adventures. You'll get a Great Engineer as your 1st or 2nd Great Person from the forge city. Use him to lightbulb Machinery and start building Berserks. You could also put your research slider at 0% for a few turns and upgrade some axes to Berserks (being Financial helps with accumulating money for that). If you catch your opponents without longbows yet, you've done really well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are limitations to your Berserks' ability to raid cities from the sea, though. If a city is defended by longbows, on a hill, has high cultural defense and/or walls, it could be difficult to take and might render an attempt not worth the cost. To attack such a city, you probably need to bring siege units along as galleys/triremes are not able to even bombard the city's defenses. Having to land siege units to bombard/deal collateral damage nullifies the Berserks' amphibious advantage. As such, you would need to look for softer targets to strike at. You don't have to keep the city. Find a weak spot (a lightly defended coastal city), raid, raze and pop back into the galleys before the enemy can counterattack. Landing a spear with the Berserker that has to land on that turn would help the latter survive a counterattack by mounted units (the most likely reaction you'll get from an AI). But becareful not to attack too close to an AI capital. AIs tend to stack more units in their capitals and can easily counterattack with a stronger force from there. Humans in MP will be wary of a sea attack, so watch out for axes/xbows in or within reach of coastal cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even if you're not playing on a water map, Berserks present some interesting options. With them, you have the advantage when laying siege to a city across a river if the enemy doesn't have Engineering. His non-mounted units cannot counter attack from the city without suffering a 20% penalty for attacking across the river. With their free Amphibious promotion, Berserks get no such penalty attacking the city. The only downside is your siege units do suffer from the penalty if you want to cause some collateral damage first. Conversely, this idea works in defense as well. When enemy units are across a river beside one of your cities, you can attack them with your Berserks with no penalty while they would suffer it when they attack. At the very least, Berserks always get their 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the most valuable thing about the Berserk is the fact that he keeps the Amphibious promotion when upgraded. This allows a Viking player to build Berserks (especially City Raider ones) and upgrade them later on to grenadiers or riflemen with free Amphibious. Frigates are able to bombard city defenses, so you can get yourself an elite amphibious attack force long before marines make their appearance. The free Amphibious also works the opposite way, allowing your older units to benefit from it when upgraded to Berserks. Hence, it makes sense to do so with all of your more experienced axemen or swordsmen. It would almost certainly be worth the money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Zulus: Impi (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] On the surface, the Impi may not appear to be a stellar UU, since it does not come with extra strength or with obviously strong bonuses. However, the tactical value of this unit is considerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Impi comes with the Mobility promotion (-1 movement cost to enter tiles that would normally cost 2 moves or more) and 2 moves. Thus, they have the ability to rapidly cross territory and catch another nation with a weakly defended city in the early game, when borders are not really expanded and cultural defenses are not high. They can be two tiles from a city and attack it on the same turn that war is declared. Thanks to Aggressive, they also start with Combat I, making them a little stronger. Furthermore, they are eligible for City Raider promotions, which would help crack the defenses of those early cities. Their relatively low cost, meanwhile, helps you amass a number of them as quickly as possible and simply bum rush a close neighbour.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They also make excellent pillagers. With the 100% bonus against mounted that spears get, the only units that can really catch them are not able to kill them effectively. Naturally, they can be put in your stacks or cities to defend and make counterattacks against mounted units. In your own territory, no enemy horse can hope to outrun them, so it's death to the common enemy pillagers![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An interesting gambit you can try is attaching a Great General to an Impi and giving him the Morale promotion, thus creating a 3-move unit with reduced terrain movement cost. If you manage to get it beyond Combat IV, you can add Commando to the collection. It's not going to be a particularly strong unit, but it might have some interesting tactical uses (such as running into a weakly defended part of an enemy empire to killl a worker and then getting out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, Impis have good synergy with the Zulu UB, the Ikhanda, which is a barrack that also acts as a mini courthouse (-20% maintenance cost for the city). Grab some cities from an unsuspecting opponent as outlined above and rush build Ikhandas in them to help pay for the early extra maintenance. Moreover, being Aggressive, Shaka builds his UB at double production speed, so it's more power to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zulus start conveniently with Hunting, which is required to build their UU, but Impis need copper or iron to be built. If you want to use them as an early attack unit, you must beeline to BW and find copper. If there's no copper around, well, then there's no hope for an Impi rush. The other downside to them is the fact that Mobility becomes useless when you upgrade them, unless you continue doing so all the way till they become mech infantry. No matter what, unroaded terrain would cost at least 1 movement point to enter and, except for mech infantry much later, the Impi's line of units only has 1 move each.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]A Comprehensive Unique Unit Guide[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]aelf[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the War Academy teaches specific strategies involving extensive use of the prominent UUs, there isn't a guide to explain the uses of the others. Strong ones like the Praetorian often need no introduction, but many players are not exposed to the possibilities that the more subtle ones present. What spurred me to start this guide are the fairly common disparaging comments about some UUs, comments that are often simply one-sided.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this guide would help you leverage the different UUs effectively or at least inspire you to be more creative with them. Give all of them a chance! But please note that this guide is written mainly for single player games. Some tips may still be useful for multiplayer, but I can't promise that. This guide also assumes that you are playing as leaders under the normal civs, which might not be true if you are playing BTS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks to [BOLD]Robo Kai, kniteowl, Cabert, Wodan, johnny_rico, gusi, UncleJJ, Bjorn190, dime, s.c.dude, drkodos, kristopherb, Elandal, Thyrwyn, Phrederick, Polycrates, Thedrin, agc28, PraetorianSteve, svv, carl corey, Andrei_V, Mr. Civtastic, Thomas G., GeneralGab, Percy, r_rolo1, facistal, jason77024, GoliathFF8[\BOLD] and [BOLD]InvisibleStalke[\BOLD] for ideas and contributions that helped make this guide possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now I shall begin. The different UUs are listed under their civs, in alphabetical order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]----------[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]America: Navy SEAL (Marine)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you've gotten over the fact that it comes very late in the game, you might realise that the Navy SEAL is actually good UU. A marine replacement, it might seem to be a niche unit. After all, how often do you conduct amphibious attacks (which include those across a river, by the way)? But take a closer look at its unique advantages and you'll realise the potential it has.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its first strike and first strike chances are not to be taken lightly. First strikes can help you deal more damage to the enemy and comfortably win battles that you might otherwise take heavy damage in or even lose. The free March promotion, meanwhile, allows the Navy SEAL to heal on the go, reducing the time it takes to recover before heading off to another battle. Bringing a Medic III unit along with your SEALs means that as soon as they have attacked, they are eligible for the 30% healing the next turn (5% from enemy territory and 25% from Medic III). So as long as they are at or above 16.8/24 strength, they will be back to full health the next turn. They can also heal right after making an amphibious assault aboard a Medic transport. The SEALs in Civ4 are indeed an elite task force worthy of their name, capable of enduring and sustaining a long campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 50% attack bonuses against machine guns and artillery are a thick layer of icing on the cake. With SEALs, you don't have to fret when attacking cities defended by machine guns (which are immune to collateral damage) without tanks. Their first strikes also help by negating the machine gun's first strikes. And, also due to their first strikes, SEALs are probably the best stack protectors against enemy artillery attacks. Divide your stack(s) into smaller SEAL-protected groups and you don't have to worry too much about getting overwhelmed by mass artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you have some coastal cities to assault or a land campaign to conduct, Navy SEALs are an excellent unit to bring along with your invasion force. They do come late, but they come at the right time if you're planning on a late domination push that would win you the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Arabia: Camel Archer (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camel Archers are knights that have a higher withdrawal chance (25%) and don't require horses or iron. You could simply use them like normal knights, but the thing about them is Flanking promotions make them very good at surviving failed attacks (+55% withdrawal chance with Flanking II). This means you don't have to balk so much at attacking a city or a stack that has a defending pike, making them more reliable as an attack unit. Of course, if you end up with no horses or iron, they give you the option of building knights in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you're playing on Warlords, stables can give your Camel Archers enough experience points to start off with Flanking I and II, so you don't have to be running Vassalage or Theocracy. Also, you can improve their ability even further by attaching Great Generals to them as warlords. Give a Flanking II Camel Archer the Tactics promotion (+30% withdrawal chance) and it would have 85% chance of retreating from a failed attack. Of course, you might still get unlucky and lose it, especially if you attack at very low odds. It's not 100% withdrawal chance, you know.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Aztecs: Jaguar Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional whipping boys, these guys get 2 free promotions in Warlords, Woodsman I and Combat I (the latter thanks to Montezuma's Aggressive trait). If you've built those cheap barracks, giving them Woodsman II immediately would allow you to rush a relatively cheap stack of them (Jaguars cost less than normal swordsmen) to enemy cities through forests and jungles, in which they have two moves. Of course, this comes at the price of not being able to give them the City Raider promotion first, but depending on how fortified the target cities are, this may not be such a problem. Jaguars do get the swordsman's inherent 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a more conventional level, the benefit of the Jaguar is probably similar to that of the Gallic Warrior - better stack protection when standing on a particular terrain. Jaguars can even defend against axemen when positioned in forests and jungles, as they get 70% terrain defense bonus there (+50% from the terrain and +20% from Woodsman I), making them good all-round defenders in this situation. Give them Woodsman II or Shock (both available immediately with barracks) and they would have no need to be afraid of axemen as long as they have trees to cover them. Hence, if the enemy's lands sport plenty of foliage, you may want to bring a few of them along in any case. Note that this applies only to [BOLD]jungles[\BOLD] in Civ4 vanilla, where Jaguars get 75% defense bonus (+50% from the terrain and +25% [BOLD]jungle[\BOLD] defense bonus).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jaguars don't require any resource so you can start building them even before hooking up copper or iron. You can also whip them out (probably with unhappy citizens) in newly conquered cities that are not connected to any metal resource, immediately creating some units for either garrison or further offensive purposes and thus helping you proceed with your campaign without having to wait for reinforcements. The value of this UU greatly increases when you find yourself without copper and iron in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More on the no resource requirement, Jaguars are a sure way to rush a neighbour early in the game. You can plant your second city on the best production site in the direction of your target without waiting for copper or iron to be revealed. Then you build barracks and granary, research IW and start whipping Jaguars out without even having to bother with any resources. Get a stack of them and attack Aztec-style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] With the addition of the Woodsman III promotion, Jaguars have become much more useful in an interesting way. Woodsman III grants 2 first strikes, +50% forest and jungle attack and the ability to heal units on the same tile at the rate of 15% per turn. Since Jaguars get Woodsman I for free and barracks can give them Woodsman II off the bat, they are effectively 2 XP away from becoming the ultimate forest/jungle warriors of their time and effective medics. If you need to take out some enemy units that are fortified in a forest/jungle, especially those that are there to choke your cities, unleash the Woodsman III Jaguars. If you need some quick healing, you have Woodsman III Jaguars. A very handy support unit to have around for early warfare. They are probably still not such effective combat units on their own, but the first strikes might help.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can even maximise the Jaguar's healing ability by attaching a Great General to it and giving it all three Medic promotions as well. Woodsman III's healing stacks with the Medic promotions (provided they are on the same unit), giving you a whooping 50% healing rate. And this isn't difficult to achieve since Jaguars get free Combat I (required for Medic I) thanks to Aggressive, so you only need 26 XP to get there. Attaching a Great General to a unit gives you 20 XP, so that Jaguar effectively only needs 6 XP, the first 3 of which can be given by barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthage: Numidian Cavalry (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] This is a UU that people are divided about. Some regard it as a good UU (though not great). Others think it is weak. The latter opinion can usually be attributed to the traditional aversion to horse archers, Horseback Riding (HBR) and Archery (techs required to build horse archer-type units). Horse archers have two moves and are good for busting archer-defended cities, but they die to spearmen, rendering them easy to counter. Archery is widely viewed as a useless dead end tech early on, while HBR is fairly expensive, making it tempting to research other more beneficial techs first. The latter's beaker cost also makes it difficult to ensure that your opponents don't have spears yet by the time it's researched. Add the fact that horse archers suffer from a 10% penalty when attacking cities in Warlords, and that the Numidian Cavalry is 1 strength weaker than normal horse archers, it's easy to turn your back on the Carthaginian UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if you consider it carefully, you may find that it's actually worth something depending on the situation. In Warlords, HBR allows you to build stables (+2 exp to mounted units), which would give your horses an edge in promotions before Vassalage/Theocracy, making the tech more attractive to research early. And the Numidian Cavalry starts with Flanking I, so, with stables, you can give them Flanking II and another promotion (eg. Mobility) right off the bat. This would give them a 50% (20% natural ability + 30% from Flanking I and II) chance to withdraw from losing battles and, if you choose Mobility, the ability to more very quickly even in enemy territory. With the Charismatic trait, it's easy to get your Numidian Cavalry to the next level for yet another promotion. Don't forget that the free Flanking I would not disappear when you upgrade them to knights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those are not all. The Numidian Cavalry also gets 50% bonus vs. melee, as well as the 50% bonus vs. siege that horse archers have, making it virtually an improved axeman. It has no need to be overly afraid of spearmen, thanks to the melee bonus. And you can rely on Flanking II to increase the survival rate of your Numidian Cavalry when up against spears, or you can even the odds with Combat I and Shock. If there's no heavy cultural defense, Numidian Cavalry can do a decent job busting cities on their own, although you'll need a good number of them. As active empire defenders or counter units, they are versatile enough, having bonuses against two categories of units. As pillagers, they are excellent since spears, the easiest counter, are not as effective against them - just be sure to build stables and give them Combat I and Shock (of course, you may want a few Sentries). It may seem like a waste of their free Flanking I, but this way the enemy cannot easily drive your pillaging Numidians out. The few Flanking-promoted ones can attack enemy units guarding key resources. Remember to pillage ivory and horses first, since elephants and horse archers are the most effective counters to your UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cons of the Numidian Cavalry are their reduced strength, the 10% penalty against cities and the fact that they can't get City Raider promotions. Once there's significant cultural defense in an enemy city, expect to take huge losses if you don't bring siege weapons along. Even if there's no cultural defense and the city is not on a hill, Numidian Cavalry are actually not as strong as the city's unpromoted fortified archers, so you need to bring at least twice as many. You can beeline to HBR and rush a neighbour with a moderate stack of them to quickly capture a few cities, but don't expect them to carve out a large empire for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Horse archers no longer get the 10% city attack penalty, so the Numidian Archer is slightly stronger now. It also gains mounted units' flanking attack ability (not to be confused with Flanking promotion), whereby it does 'collateral damage' to siege units in the stack it is attacking, making it better at countering mass catapults than before. These changes certainly mean that Carthage players have something to cheer about.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Celtia: Gallic Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Gallic Warrior is a much-maligned UU. Most people wonder why an offensive unit is given a promotion for hill defense. How on earth is that going to help him attack cities, which is what it does best?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attacking a city is the culmination of an offensive movement, which begins with your entering enemy territory. If you're careful, you would want to move your stack along the safest route to the target city as far as possible, which often means favouring forests and hills over flatlands. This is where the Gallic Warrior's free Guerilla I can help. While spearmen protect your stack against mounted units and axemen/crossbows protect it from melee units, a Gallic Warrior on a hill is the best defender against counterattacking catapults and can even take over the role of the other stack-protection units. For example, if your spearman is badly injured, the Gallic Warrior can defend against chariots or horse archers as long as you're on a hill. Thus, while normal swordsmen may be badly injured before reaching the target city in these circumstances, chances are Gallic Warriors would be in better shape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And note that Gallic Warriors can be promoted with Guerilla II and III. Such units can be a thorn in your enemy's side, running through the hills pillaging mines and maybe raiding a weakly defended city or two, thanks to Guerilla III's movement bonus on hills. The 25% bonus for attacks on hills and 30% withdrawal chance that this promotion gives also make it easier for you to deal with stubborn hill cities. And now that you can build Gallic Warriors with copper in the latest versions of Warlords, this UU can make an extra early appearance for city-busting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another neat thing about this UU is the fact that you can upgrade it to more advanced units in its line without losing the free Guerilla I. So, in effect, the benefit of this UU lasts for a long time. Remember that forests can be chopped but hills are permanent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Somewhat like the Jaguar, this UU benefits from an improvement to its natural promotion branch: the change to Guerrilla III. It still gives +25% hills attack but now it gives a 50% withdrawal chance, making a Guerilla III Gallic Warrior a very effective crack troop. Need to attack that fortified hilltop city before Construction? Guerilla III Gallic Warriors can soften the defenses and have a good chance of surviving even after losing. The 50% withdrawal chance really is quite amazing, outclassing both the Flanking promotions combined. Moreover, since both Celt leaders are Charismatic, it's really easy to get to Guerrilla III. With barracks, your Gallic Warriors can start with Guerilla II and you are only 1XP away from Guerilla III. Sounds like fun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]China: Chukonu (Crossbowman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu has a fearsome reputation. Collateral damage is something well-loved by most Civ4 players, and a respectable non-siege ground unit that has the ability to inflict it would surely become the favourite of some. The biggest weakness of siege units is their inability to defend effectively. The Chukonu, however, can function as an improved crossbowman, thus having an important benefit of siege units without the drawback.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may find it hard to pinpoint the exact role of this UU, though. Crossbows are primarily a counter unit, designed to help eliminate the threat of enemy melee units, and can in turn be countered by mounted units. If the enemy builds stacks of melee, your Chukonus will tear them apart with their bonus vs melee, first strikes and collateral damage. If the enemy mixes his stacks with mounted units, Chukonus are less effective. Thanks to collateral damage and the extra first strikes, however, they are much less helpless than normal crossbows and are still able to attack such mixed stacks, although you would probably sustain losses initially. The idea is to wear the enemy units down with your extra hits and collateral damage. Given enough Chukonus, there's almost nothing you can't defeat in the field (assuming you are facing units of the same era). But the question arises: Are they more cost effective for this purpose than catapults, since the latter are cheaper? If the enemy only has melee units then the answer is clearly yes. If the enemy has mounted units (which may be immune to first strikes) in his stack, sending in a few scuicide catapults first would probably be a better idea. The Chukonus can do semi-cleanup, dealing even more collateral damage to the enemy units and making them extremely weak and easy for more Chukonus or other units to take out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can apply the same concept when attacking a city. Siege units are still needed to remove the city's defenses, but who does the first few assaults would depend on what sort of units are defending the city. If they are macemen and pikemen/spearmen, use your Chukonus. If there are archery/mounted units in the city, use the siege units first, followed by the Chukonus and finally the cleanup crew (if you have any). Remember, Chukonus don't get City Raider promotions, so be prepared to lose some as they attack at lower odds than your CR units might have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu's first strikes are useful on the offense, but they become the primary advantage on the defense. When Chukonus are defending, they won't get to inflict any collateral damage on the enemy units, but their first strikes would be a great boost. First strikes grant chances of hitting the enemy unit before the combat proper even begins, thus improving your odds. The stronger your unit is compared to the enemy's the better first strikes are, since the hits you score would do more damage, thus increasing the possibility of your unit winning without taking much damage. This makes them even better a defense against enemy melee units than normal crossbows. Their first strikes also work well when defending against siege weapons, since they might be able to win before much collateral damage is suffered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you give your Chukonus Drill promotions for more first strikes is up to you. Note that this UU has higher chances of being promoted than normal crossbowmen, since they are more suitable for an offensive role, making it possible to accumulate quite a few Drill promotions and a lot first strikes. Moreover, if you're playing on Warlords, both Chinese leaders are Protective, so Chukonus start with Drill I, giving you a headstart in that line of promotions. Gunpowder units can't choose Drill, so upgraded Chukonus can be interesting. Incidentally, Protective also makes the Chukonu better at defending cities, thanks to the free City Garrison I promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a final note, here's a tip on how to get Chukonus early and really overrun your neighbours: Choose Qin Shi Huang as your leader and aim to build the Oracle to grab Metal Casting (requires Pottery and Bronze Working). The Industrious trait makes getting the Oracle viable, even without marble. Metal Casting leads to Machinery, but it also allows you to build your cheap Industrious forges. Build one asap and run an engineer specialist. When a Great Engineer is born, use him to lightbulb Machinery, giving you access to the Chinese UU very early. But do note that Machinery requires Iron Working and Chukonus need the iron resource to be built, so make sure you get this tech researched while waiting for the GE to be born. The worst scenario is finding no iron in your territory. To help prevent this situation, research Iron Working as quickly as possible to locate iron resources and claim them if necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Egypt: War Chariot (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At 5 strength, the Egyptian War Chariot is essentially an axeman on wheels with no City Raider promotions but has withdrawal chance. It is a very powerful and mobile unit that can win your game from as early as the Ancient Era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An Egyptian player who does not have copper has less to worry about. In fact, horses are much more important for him/her, making Animal Husbandry (AH) a priority. And since Egypt starts with Agriculture, which leads to AH, things are pretty much set up for you. Egypt also starts with The Wheel, which is required to build chariots and roads (to hook up those horses). What serendipity! Feel free to delay Bronze Working till you wish to use Slavery, unless it turns out that there are no horses within reasonable distance. If you discover horses nearby, get a settler there as soon as possible and hook it up. You can then begin preparing for your offensive. Chariot rushing has never been so effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the chariot rush tactic of pillaging the enemy's metal mines should still be applied, War Chariots aren't as afraid of spears as normal chariots because of their increased strength. Additionally, you can give them the Shock promotion to help deal with enemy spears that you might encounter. This would also help vanilla players who face enemy axemen, since the chariot bonus vs. axes applies only after Warlords (vanilla players are somewhat compensated by having 20% withdrawal chance instead of just 10%, though). That said, I have found Flanking promotions a generally better choice when up against spears. Even with Shock, War Chariots have lower odds of winning, so you might as well increase their survival rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little later in the game, a combination of War Chariots and axes would be good to guard against counterattacking spears, since War Chariots don't get defensive bonuses and would almost certainly lose all the time. In most games, axes (and maybe swords) would gradually replace them as the premier city raiders anyway. As enemy cities accumulate more defensive ratings, those spears become more and more costly to dislodge with War Chariots alone. The loss in mobility that would result from this handing over is usually nothing to worry about, since it corresponds roughly to the time when you need to expand at a slower pace until you can get upkeep costs down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Speaking of upkeep, be wary of over-expanding with War Chariots. It's easy to fall into this trap since they pack a good punch so early in the game. While judicious use of them might mean smooth sailing for the rest of the game, their careless use can ruin you as you fall hopelessly behind in terms of technology and development paying upkeep, especially on the higher levels. This and the lack of close neighbours are the greatest early adversaries of the Egyptian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]England: Redcoat (Rifleman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The terror of your enemies in Civ4 vanilla, this unit is dramatically different in Warlords. In the former, it has 16 strength compared to the normal rifleman's 14 and an additional 25% bonus vs. gunpowder units. Hence, they are uber powerful in their era, quite unmatched by any other unit until infantry. The use of the Redcoat on vanilla is, therefore, quite straightforward. Build lots of them and/or upgrade your CR units to them and go on the offensive. Combine them with cannons for even greater effect and watch the colours on the minimap change rapidly. Even grenadiers are unable to counter them effectively due to their additional bonus. The only way the enemy can really fight back is by throwing lots of cannons at them, but you can always spread your stacks out, and the AI isn't likely to do that anyway. Don't let the enemy get machine guns, though. These are a sure counter to Redcoats on the defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, however, it's not so easy. Redcoats have the same base strength as normal riflemen. They only retain their bonus vs. gunpowder units. That said, they are still quite effective. Given no terrain or promotion-based bonuses, no unit of the same era can beat them when they attack. They are vulnerable to attacks by enemy grenadiers now, but still not as badly as in the case of normal riflemen. They own any other unit when defending. You can still use this UU the same way, but more careful planning is required. A proper defense against enemy grenadiers must now be provided for, and cannons play a greater role. Do note that Redcoats have no advantage over normal rifles when attacking cities defended by longbows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, you must consider the Churchill factor as well. The new English leader is Charismatic and Protective, making his gunpowder units especially effective. They start with City Garrison I and Drill I and require fewer xp points get promoted. As city defenders, Churchill's Redcoats are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are also better on the offensive, since Drill helps in any combat situation and, thanks to the free City Garrison, you can better defend newly captured cities against enemy counterattacks. Some players even consider Churchill part of the reason why Redcoats had to be nerfed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A final point on this UU: Drill IV Redcoats are formidable. They get a total of 5 first strikes and a chance at another (immunity from first strikes are rare enough post-Gunpowder), an extra 10% bonus vs. mounted units and an amazing 60% reduction of any collateral damage sustained. These units are likely to take less damage in every way and win more often. And, in Warlords, Drill counts as a prerequisite promotion towards Cover, Formation and other "vs unit type" promotions. Hence, units with Drill are not condemned by not choosing Combat, should the need for those promotions arise. Especially valuable is the availability of Pinch as a promotion, since it helps to neutralise the threat of attacking grenadiers. The trouble is gunpowder (and melee) units don't get Drill promotions, so it's only possible to create such units by upgrading your archery units to Redcoats, which requires you to set aside a tidy sum. To make matters worse, archery units are generally not used offensively and are thus difficult to promote. However, the good news is Churchill players can do this more easily. With the Protective trait giving free Drill I to your archery units and Charismatic making promotions easier to obtain, you can use crossbows (the most likely candidate, since it has greater offensive value compared to archers and longbows) extensively in the hopes of getting some of them up to Drill IV to be upgraded later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Redcoat has indirectly been improved from its Warlords version since all gunpowder units can now receive Drill promotions. That means elite Drill Redcoats are much closer to reality, especially for Churchill. Gone are the days when you have to upgrade archery units to get them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ethiopia: Oromo Warrior (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Musket UUs generally don't get a lot of love, although the ones that the game has to offer are actually quite useful. But even if you're really not a fan of musket UUs, give the Oromo Warrior a try before you knock it. It is immune to First Strikes and starts with Drill I and II promotions; that means 2-3 First Strikes and -20% to collateral damage received out of the box. And if you throw the experience from barracks in, you get Drill III Oromo Warriors straight off the assembly line. Just add in Theocracy/Vassalage or a military instructor and you can be training Drill IV Oromos. Naturally, this UU has a potentially high survival rate, even after being battered by siege weapons (thanks to the Drill promotions' protection against collateral damage of up to 60%). They will perform normal muskets' defensive role extra well, and you need not be so hesitant about using them to attack even when faced with knights. Longbows are also less of a worry since Oromos are immune to First Strikes. Moreover, they are draftable, and you can get Drill III draftees with just Theocracy/Vassalage/a military instructor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If those aren't enough, you needn't worry so much about this musket UU getting obsolete quickly (BTS has delayed the advent of grenadiers to prolong the life of muskets anyway) because the promotions will remain on them when they are upgraded to riflemen. You might have read about the elusive elite Drill IV Redcoats. Well, with Ethiopia, Drill IV riflemen are a lot easier to come by. Suddenly those enemy cannons are not so scary anymore, are they?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]France: Musketeer (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they are 1 strength point weaker than knights, musketmen have no hard counter in their time, which is the whole point of this unit. Also, knights don't get defensive bonuses so they are not as good at defending. Musketmen fare well as an all-round stack protector. And when one of your cities is threatened, wouldn't it be ideal to have a versatile defender that can counterattack as well? Remember that musketmen can be drafted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, think of the potential uses of Musketeers, which are musketmen with 2 moves. They can reinforce any threatened city quickly, which makes them potentially more effective as city defenders than longbowmen. And when you need stack protection during a campaign, Musketeers, besides being an insurance that covers you against everything except knights and Pinch elephants (both of which you can simply counter by bringing pikes), are also able to pillage along the way with the extra move (which can be useful for taking out strategic resources). Not just that, their speed means you can have reserves catching up with your stack to take over the role of their wounded comrades should your stack come under attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Offensively, they have their uses as well. Musketeers can do clean-up work when all your siege weapons and CR units have spent their move attacking, since they have 9 base strength and aren't countered by any particular unit. And, of course, they are great for a pillaging campaign. Mix them with pikemen in small stacks and they can move and pillage within a single turn and with near impunity. Versatility is the name of the Musketeer game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A major gripe that people have about this UU is the fact that it obsoletes too quickly, since Chemistry is effectively only a few techs away. Moreover, nothing upgrades to muskets and you have to build them from scratch, further narrowing their window of opportunity. The Musketeers' speed actually helps to alleviate this problem, since you can get them to the frontline to be used a lot more quickly compared to normal musketmen. Also, researching Nationalism and switching to Nationhood to draft can help you get enough of them out in time to be used to full effect. You can stay in Nationhood and research towards Rifling next, so that you can soon start drafting riflemen to complete your offensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this note, there's another interesting use for Musketeers. Try postponing Chemistry and beelining to Military Tradition for early cavalry. Research techs along the Education route, be the first to get Liberalism and grab Nationalism as the free tech. Then research Gunpowder (which is also needed for cavalry), start drafting/building Musketeers (you may use them first if you want), research Military Tradition (requires Music, which you should trade for) and start building cavalry. Escort your cavalry with Musketeers and either launch a lightning campaign or pillage with impunity. Only Musketeers can keep up with cavalry while protecting them against costly counterattacks by enemy pikes. Flanking cavalry often prevail against longbow-defended cities by themselves with relatively low casualty rates, so even if you plan on taking cities, there might not be a need to bring slow siege weapons along. If you do this right, you can finish off one or two neighbours just like that, before they can build riflemen to counter your cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Germany: Panzer (Tank)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite being the latest UU in the game, the Panzer really packs a punch. A tank with 50% bonus versus armour units, it will eat other tanks alive and beat even modern armour. This gives them the power to dominate the battlefield. Just watch out for those gunships, which are an effective counter to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you get Panzers before the enemy gets Flight, you can solve this problem by beelining for enemy oil wells and pillaging them to prevent him/her from building a single gunship in the first place. This should be relatively easy to do, since the enemy can't stop you with his/her own tanks. Once that is done, you'd be facing mostly gunpowder units, against which the Pinch promotion would be effective in the field. With it, the Panzer can match even mech infantry, unless the latter is better promoted or is receiving defensive bonuses. And with the free Blitz promotion that tanks have, a stack of Panzers can annihilate up to double the number units in a turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When taking cities, the Panzer might only be as effective as a normal tank, since you are likely to face many gunpowder units, which receive defensive bonuses unlike armour units. But that is alright, since tanks are excellent at taking cities anyway, having access to both Barrage and City Raider promotions. After you've chewed through the toughest defenders, whatever armour is sitting in the city would be easy pickings. Apply the blitzkrieg strategy by using your bombers to soften city defenses before rapidly moving in with your City Raider Panzers. Be sure to have some Drill Panzers to clean up, since they are good at taking out the weaker units without suffering much damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem with this UU is how late it appears. It is enabled by Industrialism but requires oil, which means you have to get Combustion and build oil wells in addition to it, placing it even later in the timeline than Navy SEALs. Many players would have won the game by then, or at least they would be in such dominant or winning positions that having Panzers would have little influence on the outcome. Once you get them, however, they can last till the end of the game. Their ability to stand up to modern armour means you can delay getting Composites and survive without aluminum. Even if modern armour is already available, you would probably want to leave some of your Panzers un-upgraded as a versatile counter to enemy armour. Of course, you must have oil to build Panzers in the first place. Being German and not having oil in the later eras in a tightly contested game would be a shame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greece: Phalanx (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx, derided by some, is in fact one of the stronger UUs in the game. With 5 strength and +25% hill defense (not to be confused with free Guerilla promotion), it has enough qualities to set it far above normal spearmen. Don't forget that it also gets free Combat I from Alexander's Aggressive trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx is essentially a super spearman. However, if you build them early enough in single player, chances are the AI might not have anything except archers. Thus, it would do just as well as the axeman when used as a rush unit, except that it holds the ground better on hills and isn't afraid of Warlords' chariots (which get +100% attack vs. axemen). The fact that the Greeks start with Hunting (which is required to build the UU) certainly helps if you are thinking of rushing with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In its conventional role, the Phalanx also boasts a very long lifespan of more than two eras. Elephants give normal spearmen cause to worry, while knights are too strong be countered well by them. Phalangites, however, are able to counter elephants effectively and hold their own against knights. When they are defending on hills, no mounted unit before cavalry can beat them one-on-one without having at least the Shock promotion (perhaps with the exception of the melee-busting Conquistadors). They are also good at defending on hills, especially in hill cities, against most units in the Ancient and Classical eras. A truly solid package for a UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Phalanx has, for better or worse, been changed in BTS. It is now an axeman that is not vulnerable to chariots. That means chariots do not get a 100% bonus when attacking them. This effectively transforms a defensive UU into an offensive one, as Greek players need not worry about having to protect their earliest city raiding units from chariots. If you are the kind of player who says the glass is half empty, this change at most saves you from having to build a few spearmen and to research Hunting before you begin an axe rush. But if you like to say the glass is half full, this makes a strong rush unit that is exactly like the axeman in vanilla, which can only be countered by another axeman. Indeed, saving you the effort of building spearmen can be crucial in the early game, when cities are few and hammers are scarce. It can mean a few extra Phalanxes, which might decide whether you can take and hold a (or an extra) city or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the defense, the new Phalanx also performs decently in the early game. Now you don't have to build spearmen to deal with the occasional pillaging chariot, though of course spears would be more effective. Not having to build spearmen might also mean having extra Phalanxes to defend against an enemy axe rush. You might prefer the old version of this UU, but you can't say the new one isn't useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Inca: Quechua (Warrior)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dubbed by some as one of the worst UUs when Civ4 was still new, the Quechua has gained notoriety through the Quechua rush, a strategy that might win you a Deity game even if it's far above your current skill level. How is that possible, you ask? Quechuas are cheap at 15 hammers each (cheaper than half an axeman) and they get a 100% bonus against archers, the AI's primary/only city garrison unit early in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush is simple to do. You can probably start building Quechuas in the beginning and overwhelm the nearest AI capital with numbers (provided you've located it, of course). However, it's advisable that you build a worker, barracks and another worker first. The first worker would improve food resources (for whipping), build mines and chop trees, while the second would start building a road to the nearest AI capital (which, presumably, you would have found by then) and make logistics less of a nightmare. The barracks allows your capital to grow in between the worker builds, but, more importantly, it allows you to build Quechuas with Cover. In vanilla, Huayna Capac is Aggressive and hence Quechuas get Combat I free, allowing you to promote them with Cover immediately if you've built a barracks. Even though the Inca leader is no longer Aggressive in Warlords, Quechuas still get Combat I free, so this tactic still applies. Quechuas with Cover have a much higher chance of winning against fortified archers so you don't need as many of them. You would be able to capture one AI city after another much more quickly. This method also has the benefit of allowing the AIs to settle more cities before you attack, thus giving you early game expansion possibilities without having to build your own settlers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have the workers and barracks (and have researched Mining and Bronze Working), you can start building, chopping or whipping Quechuas out. If copper is discovered within your territory, you can supplement your rush with axemen, who can gradually take over as your main city raiders, ensuring that your offensive is longer-lasting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush does have its limitations. It requires a close neighbour. Otherwise, it would take too long to get there and you would have to pay an unreasonable amount of distance upkeep if you succeed in capturing the city. Of course, you can resort to razing, but this strategy would then lose half its value. It also assumes that the AI builds archers to defend itself. On that note, you need to be playing at a high enough difficulty, where the AI can either build archers immediately or soon enough. Warriors might be too cost-effective for Quechuas to be facing, even though you can choose the Shock promotion instead of Cover. A higher difficulty level also means the AI is likely to start with a free settler or two and would thus have more cities up for grabs when you begin your rush. The AI may also conveniently choose to settle his cities towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside to this rush is the relatively high amount of unit upkeep that you have to pay early in the game. Coupled with the distance maintenance you have to pay for captured cities, your early technological development might be retarded for a while. You can, however, count on being able to catch up fairly quickly if you've nabbed an especially powerful neighbouring capital. Huayna's Financial trait can also help you recover more quickly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond this strategy, the Quechua's usefulness is quite limited. They are effective against barbarians, since those often take the form of archers, and would hence perform well under raging barbs setting. They are also better than normal warriors at worker stealing (since they survive better against archers), should you choose to be aggressive from the start even though you have no plans of capturing enemy cities yet. Besides these, it's hard to conceive of another way to exploit this UU without rushing, making it rather situational. It either shines or fades into relative oblivion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]India: Fast Worker (Worker)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Fast Worker is a worker with 3 moves (which, interestingly enough, is unmatched till gunships in the modern age). This means, with all their moves unspent, they can enter forest/jungle/hill and immediately begin improving the tile without ending their turn. However, they do end their turn if they enter a forested/jungled hill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indirectly, this means the Fast Worker is faster at doing what workers do. It does not improve tiles faster, but being able to begin earlier in many situations would translate to a lot of saved worker turns by the end of the game. By the way, yes, it is the only UU that lasts throughout the game. Their extra movement also means they are able to cover distances more quickly, allowing you to move them around your empire efficiently. This enables a much tighter worker strategy, where you can have fewer workers improving tiles in different cities according to which city would grow and work the tiles next. To put it simply, playing as India, you do not need as many workers to develop your land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To get the most out of this UU, adopt an early worker strategy (i.e. building a worker first). You'd develop much quicker than the other civs and could use this early game lead to your advantage for the rest of the game. Their 3 moves also make them excellent scouts, especially early on when revealing your surroundings quickly is crucial. Just make sure you keep them away from animals and barbs. With their speed, it shouldn't be that difficult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some players do not like the fact that it is not a military UU, but few would be able to argue against its merits. The only downside to the Fast Worker is the fact that slower game speeds diminish their advantage, since the turns saved by their extra movement would be less and less significant compared to the increased number turns needed to improve tiles. If you're playing on Quick or Normal speed, this UU is certainly amazing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Japan: Samurai (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cool factor aside, there seems to be little that is interesting about this UU at first glance. It is a regular maceman that cannot be built with copper (requiring specifically iron) and has 2 first strikes. The second thing is what gives the Samurai its power, and which has sparked considerable debate on how useful it makes this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After much testing and debate, it is generally agreed that the 2 first strikes are a great boon. They help the Samurai survive, even at lower odds, and give them an edge against archers and longbows, the primary city defenders of the day. First strikes essentially mean that the unit gets the chance to inflict damage on the enemy unit even before the combat proper begins. Both archers and longbows get 1 first strike, which help them deal with regular city attackers (i.e. units with access to City Raider promotions, such as macemen), but have this advantage cancelled out by one of the Samurai's first strikes. And the Samurai still has another first strike to use. This also applies to crossbowmen (who also get 1 first strike), making the Samurai less vulnerable to that effective anti-melee unit. And, just as importantly, this advantage also has the effect of giving Samurais a higher chance to win battles while suffering less damage. That means they are potentially able to recover faster for another attack, thereby shortening the length of the Japanese player's campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But do take note that this bonus is not the same as getting free Drill promotions (to which, by the way, macemen do not have access). It is better than merely a free Drill I, but it will not remain when you upgrade your Samurais. And beware of knights (especially Conquistadors or those with Shock promotion). They are a fast and effective counter to Samurai, since they have enough strength and ignore first strikes, so bring enough pikemen when facing a sufficiently advanced opponent who has researched Guilds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawback of the Samurai is the requirement of iron. While regular macemen can be built with copper as well, without iron, the Japanese player will be stuck without his/her UU or even regular macemen. Thankfully, this strategic resource is quite commonly available. But if you do find yourself not having one readily available, planting a city in the tundra or invading your neighbour to get it might be worth the effort before the age of the Samurai arrives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Korea: Hwacha (Catapult)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] If you like axemen, you'd love the Hwacha. It is a catapult with 50% bonus vs melee units, making it an axeman with collateral damage, bombard ability and withdrawal chance for a mere five hammers more (Normal speed). The only downside is the Hwacha doesn't receive defensive bonuses like an axeman, so you might want to use your Hwachas offensively and turn up the heat so the enemy is forced to defend in his nice cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hwacha has some interesting synergy with Wang Kon's Protective trait. Protective really shines when you have no metals and are forced to adopt a defensive position with archers in the early game. Construction represents the departure from such a stance, since you're now able to build catapults and attack. Hwachas, being super catapults, puts you in an even better position to go on the offensive, with Protective archers/longbows for support as defenders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have iron, Protective crossbows and spears/pikes are perfect companions to Hwachas. They eliminate the threat of enemy melee and mounted units and help defend new possessions while your Hwachas take down enemy defenders. You don't need axemen. A few swords to help clean up can complete your arsenal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When macemen and trebuchets come into the picture, Hwachas gradually take a back seat, but not before you can deal some serious damage to a neighbour or two. Nonetheless, a Korean player would benefit from picking up Construction as quickly as possible. Why not put this powerful weapon into use as early as you can? And Wang Kon's Financial trait can certainly help with that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Unfortunately, as it stands, the Hwacha has been weakened by the inability of siege weapons to kill units and to gain more than 1 experience point per battle. Its bonus still applies, but you can no longer rely on a stack of Hwachas to actually capture cities for you. You also need enough units to kill off all the weakened defenders. While this job can be done by almost any non-siege unit, this means hammers probably need to be diverted to other units, resulting in fewer Hwachas built. Then there's the 1xp only rule, which is worse since it means your Hwachas can no longer gain valuable additional promotions through combat, making it less effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of this UU has certainly been reduced. You can still make good use of it much in the same way as before, but remember to build more units for clean up duty and to take up the slack caused by fewer veteran Hwachas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mali: Skirmisher (Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skirmishers are archers with 4 strength and 1 extra first strike chance, effectively making Mali half a Protective civ until Feudalism comes around. With them, Malinese cities are certainly not ones to be taken easily in the early game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The normal use of Skirmishers is pretty straight forward: Defend your cities or hill improvements with them. As such, they play a rather passive role as a UU. This puts into question the rationale of going straight for Archery, even when playing Mali. First, you don't start with Hunting (required for Archery). Second, the threat of barbarian or enemy axes make axemen a better unit for defense, since they are able to counterattack and prevent your improvements from being pillaged. Lastly, Bronze Working is needed for Slavery anyway, and if you happen to find copper nearby after researching it you can soon build axes. Skirmishers can help with defense if you don't find copper around, but in that case you might want to beeline to Iron Working, so Hunting and Archery are still not the priority. But of course, in the worst case scenario where you find no metal around, Skirmishers can become quite important.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords improves Skirmishers a little by making chariots a counter to axes. Now you don't have to fear barbarian/enemy axemen if you don't have copper but have horses. Barb spearmen, if they do appear, can be countered somewhat by Skirmishers. You can thus concentrate on teching up with chariots and Skirmishers for defense, without having to beeline for the relatively expensive Iron Working. If you want to be aggressive, you can rush a neighbour with a stack of chariots and some Skirmishers. The latter can help secure newly conquered cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now for the less conventional. If you are going for a really quick rush as Mali, you can beeline to Archery from the beginning. Skirmishers don't require resources, so you can technically rush a neighbour with them Jaguar-style. Get Archery as quickly as possible, build barracks - maybe settle a second city - and start building Skirmishers. After you several of them, rush the nearest neighbour's capital. Skirmishers are better than normal archers, so with a ratio of about 3:1 in your favour, you may be able to overwhelm the defending archers. The surviving Skirmishers would then help you hold on to the conquered city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you whip to rush build Skirmishers for this tactic, becareful of the hammer overflow. You might quickly begin to whip them out for one population point each and run into serious happiness issues. If you want to try this rush, you should have a food-plenty and hilly area (i.e. a good production city site) as the site of your capital. You'll need the hammers because you'll be building most of the Skirmishers the slow way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mongolia: Keshik (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keshiks are horse archers that ignore terrain movement cost and get 1 first strike, but aren't immune to first strikes. Hence, they are extremely adept at raiding and pillaging, but aren't as good at attacking archers/longbows with Drill promotions. This has a few implications on a Mongolian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surprise is the best asset of the Keshiks. Ignoring terrain movement cost means they can traverse forests/jungles and hills as easily as flatlands. Thus, it is easy for a Mongolian player to strike across difficult terrain at the unlikeliest of places, grabbing unguarded workers and lightly-defended cities or pillaging improvements (especially on strategic resources). However, this advantage relies on the enemy's inability to counterattack immediately with spearmen or a superior force, so good intelligence would be needed to know where exactly the enemy places his spears and the bulk of his units. If you do not have this luxury, you could always send more Keshiks in case you meet spears, but be prepared to lose quite a few of them. In addition, you could pillage enemy roads to eventually cripple his ability to counterattack. However, at the end of the day, the strategic advantage you gain from your harassment must outweigh the lost hammers you spent on the dead Keshiks[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Keshiks' first strike, meanwhile, makes them better than normal horse archers at picking off non-spear units in your territory or in the enemy's. Combined with their terrain movement advantage, this makes them good empire defenders and hit-and-run units. Unfortunately, the enemy can easily counter them by having spearmen guard his units, so this might only work effectively against the AI. There's also a limitation on how good Keshiks are in fighting non-spear units compared to normal horse archers. The immunity to first strikes that normal horse archers get makes them better at fighting archery units with Drill promotions or units with Drill III/IV. The Keshiks' own first strike can only negate one of the enemy units' first strikes. To remedy this, you have to give your Keshiks Flanking II so that they get immunity to first strikes as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This, in turn, highlights the Keshik's relative weakness (compared to normal horse archers) in attacking cities defended by Drill-promoted archery units. In Warlords, this means Protective civs are better covered against attempts to take cities with Keshiks. The 10% city attack penalty that the horse archer unit-type gets in Warlords makes them even less desirable as city raiders. Thus, the only hope Mongolian player might have in using Keshiks to conquer in Warlords is to rely on speed, Flanking promotions and numbers (also applies to vanilla, but not to such a large extent).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With barracks and Ger in the city, a Keshik gets 7 xp upon being built. Unfortunately, that will still allow for only 2 initial promotions (unless you're running both Vassalage and Theocracy for a total of 11 xp), though of course your mounted units would be promoted to the next level sooner. But, at any rate, 2 initial promotions are good enough. Give most of the Keshiks Flanking I and II to give them 50% withdrawal chance each (including the natural 20%) and immunity to first strikes. Give Combat I and Medic I or Combat I and Shock (for defending against spearmen) to the rest. Have at least one Medic I Keshik and one Shock Keshik in each stack. If you get Compass early enough, you can use explorers (strength 4, ignores terrain movement cost and starts with free Guerilla I and Woodsman I) to help protect your stacks when they stop on hills or forests/jungles. 3 or 4 cities with Gers pumping out Keshiks would usually be good enough to amass a sizeable army in reasonable time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As your Keshiks attack enemy cities, some will die, some will withdraw and some will win. The medics will ensure that the withdrawing and winning Keshiks heal up more quickly. If you manage to overwhelm a prepared enemy with numbers, your speed advantage (from ignoring terrain movement cost and faster healing) will ensure that the enemy cannot fight back or resist as effectively, hastening his destruction. If the enemy is unprepared in the first place, your speed advantage will ensure his quick defeat. Note that this strategy can only work if the enemy doesn't have longbows yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You should be prepared to build courthouses and marketplaces to help you keep your winnings. But even if you're not, you can just resort to razing and pillaging for some barbaric fun. Long live the Golden Horde![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Netherlands: East Indiaman (Galleon)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Now here's an interesting UU. Although it does have some combat capability, it serves primarily as a support unit. But the East Indiaman is pretty good at it, offering an extra cargo space for a total of 4, which is quite a big leap from a normal galleon considering the fact that transports have the same capacity. If you're planning on waging war during the age of the rifle, especially against an overseas civ, or if you are planning a large-scale settling another landmass, you don't have to build quite as many ships to carry your units over. Three East Indiamen carry as much as four galleons, thereby saving you 80 hammers, which can almost make an extra frigate (90 hammers) to protect your fleet. Moreover, since they carry as many units as transports, you might not need to decommission or upgrade them till the end of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The East Indiaman also has the nifty ability to travel within rival borders without needing an open borders treaty. Have you accumulated much EPs thanks to the Financial trait? You can send your spies anywhere in the world conveniently, even directly into an unfriendly overseas civ. And the extra cargo space is useful for espionage as well, helping you keep a constant flow of spies even if many get caught.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly, the East Indiaman has 2 more strength than a normal galleon, making it tougher to sink. While it still can't beat a frigate, it can more than annihilate caravels and destroy other galleons, so you have naval superiority at Astronomy until your rivals get Chemistry and build frigates. And, should there be privateers prowling the seas, you needn't worry so much about being ambushed by them while moving units across water without escort during peacetime. This is probably a UU that you would appreciate on maps with lots of seas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ottomans: Janissary (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Janissary's advantage is a 25% boost against melee, archery and mounted units, making it a great all-round unit for its time. It is pretty much effective against all previous era units (with the big exception of siege units), so you can potentially put some serious hurt in your enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to get as much use out of Janissaries as possible, you need to look for ways to get to Gunpowder early. You might even want to make a beeline for it, either through the northern path (Maths -&gt; Currency -&gt; Priesthood? -&gt; Civil Service -&gt; Paper -&gt; Education) or the southern path (Metal Casting -&gt; Machinery &amp; Monotheism -&gt; Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guilds) in the tech tree. Different lightbulbing strategies are available (with Great Merchants for the southern path and Great Scientists for the northern one), so you don't have to self-research everything. Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do a beeline, but it's probably the best way. The point is to get to Gunpowder before your enemies are even close to it, and rapidly exploiting this opportunity gap by building, whipping and possibly drafting as many Janissaries as you can to use against them. To be able to draft, you would need to pursue the northern path and probably research Liberalism first to grab Nationalism as the free tech, before actually researching Gunpowder. It is a slight diversion, but it may be worth the delay if your empire does not have the capability to build or whip enough Janissaries in time to give you a real edge, as often is the case.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have them, Janissaries are quite a fearsome force in the medieval battlefield. They have no hard counter, so the best bet your enemies might have is to promote their units with Pinch, which requires Gunpowder in Warlords. Knights with Pinch, however, are a good counter to Jannissaries, as are regular musketmen (against whom Janissaries have no advantage whatsoever), so once your enemies have Gunpowder as well you may find your edge disappearing. If they manage to get to Chemistry, which isn't that far away, this UU is practically obsolete. Janissary stacks are actually relatively vulnerable to siege units (and the associated collateral damage) as well, since they don't get any bonuses against these. But unless you're playing MP, this shouldn't be a big problem. The AI does not generally build many catapults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also take note that Janissaries may not be the best city-taking troops you can get, since they do not have access to City Raider promotions. Needless to say, if you're relying on them as the backbone of your army, you still need to bring siege weapons along if you hope to grab some enemy territory. Given the fact that they are not actually very different from the conduct of normal campaigns of the time, Janissary campaigns might still be slow going, so don't be surprised if you don't manage to knock out more than one enemy with them, even with your best efforts (assuming you're playing on the higher levels). Hence, the emphasis is again on getting them as early as possible so as to enlarge the window of opportunity that you have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Overall, without the mobility of the Musketeer, this UU is quite situational and, to an even higher degree than the former, requires some long term planning in the early game to be put to good use. It is probably better the lower the difficulty you play on, since you would be more likely to out-tech the AIs and get to Gunpowder much earlier than them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Persia: Immortal (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It seems odd that Immortals are chariot-replacements, and you may miss the ownage days of playing as Persia with their Civ3 incarnation. Fortunately, they are still very effective in Civ4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you have horses and a neighbouring civ nearby, you know you're in for some fun. Immortals get 50% bonus vs. archery units, as well as an innate 30% withdrawal chance. No AI I've seen can resist them very early in the game. Hook up those horses quickly, build/whip out some of these creatures and head straight for the neighbour. If you managed to build barracks, you can give them Flanking I for an extra 10% withdrawal chance. If you have time to kill some barbs as well, before heading for your neighbour's cities, you can promote some with Flanking II for immunity against first strikes and a total of 60% withdrawal chance. This would give them a high survival rate against archers. Don't they sound like excellent AI city busters? What's more, they do get defensive bonuses, making them less vulnerable to counterattack and decent garrison units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If or when your enemy gets spearmen, however, Immortals lose much of their power. Even one spearman in a city you're attacking can give you a lot of trouble. You really have to count on the withdrawal chances if you want the first few Immortals to survive a direct attack on the city. In Civ4 vanilla, enemy axemen would be a problem too, since chariots don't get the 50% bonus when attacking axemen like in Warlords. To help prevent difficulties from arising, you should pillage any AI mine that you see sitting on a metal resource. If a city is on top of one, pillage the roads around it to limit spear production to that city. You would thus prolong the effectiveness of your Immortals. Until your enemy gets Feudalism, that is. If he can. Although the 50% bonus also applies when fighting longbows, the latter are too strong when defending in cities to be dislodged by Immortals alone. The same may be said of enemy crossbows. But with the help of siege weapons, Immortals can still take them down quite easily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem is when there is no neighbour near you. In that case, you can't use Immortals to their full potential. However, they are still quite handy against barbs, since the latter usually take the form of archers. In Warlords, they are also great for dispatching barb axemen. Clearly, the expansion has given this solid UU even more oomph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Rome: Praetorian (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians are a blunt instrument with which you can rule the early battlefield. Taking cities is the name of the game, and Praetorians easily destroy enemy archers defending cities (even those with some cultural defense), with odds so favorable that they'll likely not suffer losses. You may lose a few if the enemy city is on a hill and the defender has City Garrison promotions, but the odds will still favor you most of the time. You probably want to give your Praetorians City Raider (CR) promotions to help bust those cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because of their high strength, Praetorians can hold their own against axeman, their natural counter. Nevertheless, it may be best to build your own axemen or promote a few Praetorians with Combat I and Shock for stack defense. Praetorians will also prevail against mounted units of the same era, though a spearman or two will only do you good, leaving your Praetorians to focus on taking those cities. After the enemy gets longbowmen, the Praetorian is still useful, but you need to support them with catapults to remove city defenses and soften up the defenders to avoid catastrophic losses. Watch out for crossbows, though; they are very effective against Praetorians. The best way to guard against them is to pillage the enemy's iron mines before he/she can build them. The same goes for enemy Shock war elephants, in which case you should pillage his/her ivory camps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians require Iron Working and iron. A Roman player would probably want to take advantage of the Praetorian as early as possible, so beelining to Iron Working is a good call. You may want to have a settler and some workers ready to exploit any iron deposit you see as soon as the tech is researched, although there's some chance that you'd find iron within your existing borders. You should also build barracks first, so that you can give your Praetorians a promotion from the get go, whether it is CR 1 for city busting or Combat 1 for Shock later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The problem with Praetorians is the Roman player may become a victim of his own success. Because it is so easy to expand quickly with this UU, the temptation to expand beyond your limit is great. You may end up too many cities, causing your economy to crash from the upkeep. One solution is to raze cities rather than keep them, unless they are close to yours or have high value (eg. capitals, holy cities or those with wonders). This also has the effect of severely weakening or even eliminating your enemies so it is easier to actually expand when your economy is able to support it later. And, while you're doing this, do pillage the improvements around razed cities to set your enemies back even further and for extra funds. You can also help yourself by building up your infrastructure at home to support your campaigns, such as laying down lots of cottages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This UU is the main reason why it's good to play as Rome when you're new on a difficulty level. Try not to get too used to having them, though, as you might become too dependent on their strength to play with any other civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Russia: Cossack (Cavalry)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the Redcoat, the Cossack is one UU that has been changed in Warlords. In Civ IV vanilla, the Cossack has a fearsome reputation. A cavalry with 18 strength and +50% against mounted units on top of the ordinary cavalry capabilities (+50% against cannon and 30% withdrawal chance), it can beat almost every unit in its era. Even riflemen, its counter, have less strength if you don't consider promotions or defensive bonuses. Pinch-promoted Cossacks can eat them alive. Riflemen need to be one level higher (4) and get the Formation promotion to even out the playing field, though you should note that Aggressive riflemen can get Formation at level 3. Redcoats do counter Cossacks very well, but Cossacks are faster, can withdraw and aren't destroyed by machine guns and massed cannons the way Redcoats are.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you are using them in the vanilla game, consider getting them as early as possible by beelining to Education, getting Liberalism and choosing Nationalism as the free tech. Nationalism leads to Military Tradition (requires Music, so make sure you trade for it) and Education leads to Gunpowder, techs needed to build Cossacks (and you must have horses, of course). If you pull this off early enough, the rest of the game should be easy - Cossacks versus longbowmen is no contest. You can shoot for a domination victory right away. All you need to do is keep pumping out Cossacks, with the whip whenever possible, while ideally running the military civics (Vassalage and Theocracy) to give your Cossacks an even bigger edge. It's no wonder that some people consider them overpowered in vanilla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords, however, is a vastly different game for Cossack fans. On one hand, there's the introduction of the stable, which improves mounted units by giving them 2 more experience points. On the other hand, the Cossack has the same strength as normal cavalry now, only retaining their bonus against mounted units. They are basically cavalry that excel in killing other cavalry. This is a lot more useful in MP, where cavalry versus cavalry is pretty much a fair game and you need to get riflemen to gain an advantage. Having Cossacks means you already have an advantage against enemy cavalry, forcing your enemies to tech to riflemen to stand a chance on the battlefield or risk being holed up in their cities and becoming sitting targets for your cannons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In SP, however, much of the action would ideally take place at enemy cities to begin with, and in this respect the Cossack is mostly as good as normal cavalry in Warlords. It can get the 2 extra experience points from stables, but so can normal cavalry. The only time you have a real advantage against the AI is when it masses cavalry. In that case, your Cossacks would cut through the AI's army like knife through butter. Unfortunately, you would probably have to capture cities to end the war anyway. That said, Cossacks are pretty good for pillaging if you promote them with Pinch, since they would then be more difficult to counter (neither riflemen nor cavalry would work effectively against them). But, still, as you can see, what was an amazing UU has become a pretty situational one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spain: Conquistador (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this UU, the road to El Dorado can be wide and clear. It has the potential to be exploited in a game-breaking way. The reason is this: Conquistadors get 50% bonus vs. melee, which gives it an advantage against the most common counter to knights - pikemen. They also get defensive bonuses, which means they can exploit the terrain to make counterattack difficult. To top all of this off, Conquistadors benefit from 2 first strikes (which normal knights don't get), making them even harder to defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need horse and iron to produce this UU. Playing as Spain, I'd make sure I get those by the time Conquistadors can be built. The Spanish player would also do well to research Guilds early, extending the life and usefulness of the UU. Conquistadors can fill the role of your main city attackers, following your siege weapons to capture city after city. They don't get CR upgrades, but they can perform decently against city defenders even when they haven't accumulated promotions. Their first strikes and immunity to first strikes certainly help, especially against longbows. And, thanks to their bonus against melee, defending pikes don't scare them that much. With defensive bonuses to help, they can also act as stack-protectors during your campaigns. Furthermore, since they have 2 moves, they can attack enemy units and come back to the stack in the same turn. If you're playing on Warlords, they make the perfect companions to Citadel-improved siege weapons. Woe to the enemy cities![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once those shiny cities have been taken, Conquistadors can help defend them until you get suitable defenders (such as longbowmen) there. This works especially well if a city is on a hill. As you can see, the versatility of the Conquistador almost matches that of the Musketeer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, here are a few words of caution. Siege weapons are not to be excluded from your Conquistador campaigns. Unless your target is still fielding archers, bringing siege units for bombardment and some collateral damage should still be part and parcel of your plans. Conquistadors are strong but not invincible. Without the proper support, they would still die to entrenched units, especially pikes and longbows. The other thing is, beware of elephants! These are the ultimate counter to Conquistadors. Under normal circumstances, there is no way a Conquistador can beat an elephant, and the latter is much cheaper to train. Just make sure you target opponents who have no ivory and you should have great time conquering with this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vikings: Berserk (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] Hate them or love them, Berserks are a popular UU. Although, not as powerful as their Civ3 incarnation, these guys can really be useful. Their 10% bonus vs. cities is certainly nice. However, for many people the problem is finding a good use for their free Amphibious promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings have a higher potential to rule on water maps than any other civ. Ragnar is Financial, which means coastal tiles produce 3 commerce instead of 2, and his UB allows his ships to move further earlier in the game by giving free Navigation promotion. Combined with the Berserk's ability to attack amphibiously with no penalty and its city attack bonus, a Viking player on a water map can fast tech to Civil Service and Machinery and have fun raiding enemy coastal cities with Berserks on fast galleys. One method to do this early is building the Oracle and grabbing Metal Casting as the free tech (which, by the way, gives access to Colossus for a further boost to those coastal tiles). Then build/whip a forge and run an engineer in a city without the Oracle. Research your way to Code of Laws and Civil Service a.s.a.p. (in the pre-patch version you can use a prophet generated by the Oracle to lightbulb CoL/CS by not researching Masonry). In the meantime, build several galleys to prepare for your sea adventures. You'll get a Great Engineer as your 1st or 2nd Great Person from the forge city. Use him to lightbulb Machinery and start building Berserks. You could also put your research slider at 0% for a few turns and upgrade some axes to Berserks (being Financial helps with accumulating money for that). If you catch your opponents without longbows yet, you've done really well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are limitations to your Berserks' ability to raid cities from the sea, though. If a city is defended by longbows, on a hill, has high cultural defense and/or walls, it could be difficult to take and might render an attempt not worth the cost. To attack such a city, you probably need to bring siege units along as galleys/triremes are not able to even bombard the city's defenses. Having to land siege units to bombard/deal collateral damage nullifies the Berserks' amphibious advantage. As such, you would need to look for softer targets to strike at. You don't have to keep the city. Find a weak spot (a lightly defended coastal city), raid, raze and pop back into the galleys before the enemy can counterattack. Landing a spear with the Berserker that has to land on that turn would help the latter survive a counterattack by mounted units (the most likely reaction you'll get from an AI). But becareful not to attack too close to an AI capital. AIs tend to stack more units in their capitals and can easily counterattack with a stronger force from there. Humans in MP will be wary of a sea attack, so watch out for axes/xbows in or within reach of coastal cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even if you're not playing on a water map, Berserks present some interesting options. With them, you have the advantage when laying siege to a city across a river if the enemy doesn't have Engineering. His non-mounted units cannot counter attack from the city without suffering a 20% penalty for attacking across the river. With their free Amphibious promotion, Berserks get no such penalty attacking the city. The only downside is your siege units do suffer from the penalty if you want to cause some collateral damage first. Conversely, this idea works in defense as well. When enemy units are across a river beside one of your cities, you can attack them with your Berserks with no penalty while they would suffer it when they attack. At the very least, Berserks always get their 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the most valuable thing about the Berserk is the fact that he keeps the Amphibious promotion when upgraded. This allows a Viking player to build Berserks (especially City Raider ones) and upgrade them later on to grenadiers or riflemen with free Amphibious. Frigates are able to bombard city defenses, so you can get yourself an elite amphibious attack force long before marines make their appearance. The free Amphibious also works the opposite way, allowing your older units to benefit from it when upgraded to Berserks. Hence, it makes sense to do so with all of your more experienced axemen or swordsmen. It would almost certainly be worth the money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Zulus: Impi (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] On the surface, the Impi may not appear to be a stellar UU, since it does not come with extra strength or with obviously strong bonuses. However, the tactical value of this unit is considerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Impi comes with the Mobility promotion (-1 movement cost to enter tiles that would normally cost 2 moves or more) and 2 moves. Thus, they have the ability to rapidly cross territory and catch another nation with a weakly defended city in the early game, when borders are not really expanded and cultural defenses are not high. They can be two tiles from a city and attack it on the same turn that war is declared. Thanks to Aggressive, they also start with Combat I, making them a little stronger. Furthermore, they are eligible for City Raider promotions, which would help crack the defenses of those early cities. Their relatively low cost, meanwhile, helps you amass a number of them as quickly as possible and simply bum rush a close neighbour.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They also make excellent pillagers. With the 100% bonus against mounted that spears get, the only units that can really catch them are not able to kill them effectively. Naturally, they can be put in your stacks or cities to defend and make counterattacks against mounted units. In your own territory, no enemy horse can hope to outrun them, so it's death to the common enemy pillagers![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An interesting gambit you can try is attaching a Great General to an Impi and giving him the Morale promotion, thus creating a 3-move unit with reduced terrain movement cost. If you manage to get it beyond Combat IV, you can add Commando to the collection. It's not going to be a particularly strong unit, but it might have some interesting tactical uses (such as running into a weakly defended part of an enemy empire to killl a worker and then getting out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, Impis have good synergy with the Zulu UB, the Ikhanda, which is a barrack that also acts as a mini courthouse (-20% maintenance cost for the city). Grab some cities from an unsuspecting opponent as outlined above and rush build Ikhandas in them to help pay for the early extra maintenance. Moreover, being Aggressive, Shaka builds his UB at double production speed, so it's more power to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zulus start conveniently with Hunting, which is required to build their UU, but Impis need copper or iron to be built. If you want to use them as an early attack unit, you must beeline to BW and find copper. If there's no copper around, well, then there's no hope for an Impi rush. The other downside to them is the fact that Mobility becomes useless when you upgrade them, unless you continue doing so all the way till they become mech infantry. No matter what, unroaded terrain would cost at least 1 movement point to enter and, except for mech infantry much later, the Impi's line of units only has 1 move each.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]A Comprehensive Unique Unit Guide[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]aelf[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the War Academy teaches specific strategies involving extensive use of the prominent UUs, there isn't a guide to explain the uses of the others. Strong ones like the Praetorian often need no introduction, but many players are not exposed to the possibilities that the more subtle ones present. What spurred me to start this guide are the fairly common disparaging comments about some UUs, comments that are often simply one-sided.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope this guide would help you leverage the different UUs effectively or at least inspire you to be more creative with them. Give all of them a chance! But please note that this guide is written mainly for single player games. Some tips may still be useful for multiplayer, but I can't promise that. This guide also assumes that you are playing as leaders under the normal civs, which might not be true if you are playing BTS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thanks to [BOLD]Robo Kai, kniteowl, Cabert, Wodan, johnny_rico, gusi, UncleJJ, Bjorn190, dime, s.c.dude, drkodos, kristopherb, Elandal, Thyrwyn, Phrederick, Polycrates, Thedrin, agc28, PraetorianSteve, svv, carl corey, Andrei_V, Mr. Civtastic, Thomas G., GeneralGab, Percy, r_rolo1, facistal, jason77024, GoliathFF8[\BOLD] and [BOLD]InvisibleStalke[\BOLD] for ideas and contributions that helped make this guide possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now I shall begin. The different UUs are listed under their civs, in alphabetical order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]----------[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]America: Navy SEAL (Marine)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you've gotten over the fact that it comes very late in the game, you might realise that the Navy SEAL is actually good UU. A marine replacement, it might seem to be a niche unit. After all, how often do you conduct amphibious attacks (which include those across a river, by the way)? But take a closer look at its unique advantages and you'll realise the potential it has.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its first strike and first strike chances are not to be taken lightly. First strikes can help you deal more damage to the enemy and comfortably win battles that you might otherwise take heavy damage in or even lose. The free March promotion, meanwhile, allows the Navy SEAL to heal on the go, reducing the time it takes to recover before heading off to another battle. Bringing a Medic III unit along with your SEALs means that as soon as they have attacked, they are eligible for the 30% healing the next turn (5% from enemy territory and 25% from Medic III). So as long as they are at or above 16.8/24 strength, they will be back to full health the next turn. They can also heal right after making an amphibious assault aboard a Medic transport. The SEALs in Civ4 are indeed an elite task force worthy of their name, capable of enduring and sustaining a long campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The 50% attack bonuses against machine guns and artillery are a thick layer of icing on the cake. With SEALs, you don't have to fret when attacking cities defended by machine guns (which are immune to collateral damage) without tanks. Their first strikes also help by negating the machine gun's first strikes. And, also due to their first strikes, SEALs are probably the best stack protectors against enemy artillery attacks. Divide your stack(s) into smaller SEAL-protected groups and you don't have to worry too much about getting overwhelmed by mass artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you have some coastal cities to assault or a land campaign to conduct, Navy SEALs are an excellent unit to bring along with your invasion force. They do come late, but they come at the right time if you're planning on a late domination push that would win you the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Arabia: Camel Archer (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camel Archers are knights that have a higher withdrawal chance (25%) and don't require horses or iron. You could simply use them like normal knights, but the thing about them is Flanking promotions make them very good at surviving failed attacks (+55% withdrawal chance with Flanking II). This means you don't have to balk so much at attacking a city or a stack that has a defending pike, making them more reliable as an attack unit. Of course, if you end up with no horses or iron, they give you the option of building knights in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you're playing on Warlords, stables can give your Camel Archers enough experience points to start off with Flanking I and II, so you don't have to be running Vassalage or Theocracy. Also, you can improve their ability even further by attaching Great Generals to them as warlords. Give a Flanking II Camel Archer the Tactics promotion (+30% withdrawal chance) and it would have 85% chance of retreating from a failed attack. Of course, you might still get unlucky and lose it, especially if you attack at very low odds. It's not 100% withdrawal chance, you know.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Aztecs: Jaguar Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traditional whipping boys, these guys get 2 free promotions in Warlords, Woodsman I and Combat I (the latter thanks to Montezuma's Aggressive trait). If you've built those cheap barracks, giving them Woodsman II immediately would allow you to rush a relatively cheap stack of them (Jaguars cost less than normal swordsmen) to enemy cities through forests and jungles, in which they have two moves. Of course, this comes at the price of not being able to give them the City Raider promotion first, but depending on how fortified the target cities are, this may not be such a problem. Jaguars do get the swordsman's inherent 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a more conventional level, the benefit of the Jaguar is probably similar to that of the Gallic Warrior - better stack protection when standing on a particular terrain. Jaguars can even defend against axemen when positioned in forests and jungles, as they get 70% terrain defense bonus there (+50% from the terrain and +20% from Woodsman I), making them good all-round defenders in this situation. Give them Woodsman II or Shock (both available immediately with barracks) and they would have no need to be afraid of axemen as long as they have trees to cover them. Hence, if the enemy's lands sport plenty of foliage, you may want to bring a few of them along in any case. Note that this applies only to [BOLD]jungles[\BOLD] in Civ4 vanilla, where Jaguars get 75% defense bonus (+50% from the terrain and +25% [BOLD]jungle[\BOLD] defense bonus).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jaguars don't require any resource so you can start building them even before hooking up copper or iron. You can also whip them out (probably with unhappy citizens) in newly conquered cities that are not connected to any metal resource, immediately creating some units for either garrison or further offensive purposes and thus helping you proceed with your campaign without having to wait for reinforcements. The value of this UU greatly increases when you find yourself without copper and iron in the first place.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More on the no resource requirement, Jaguars are a sure way to rush a neighbour early in the game. You can plant your second city on the best production site in the direction of your target without waiting for copper or iron to be revealed. Then you build barracks and granary, research IW and start whipping Jaguars out without even having to bother with any resources. Get a stack of them and attack Aztec-style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] With the addition of the Woodsman III promotion, Jaguars have become much more useful in an interesting way. Woodsman III grants 2 first strikes, +50% forest and jungle attack and the ability to heal units on the same tile at the rate of 15% per turn. Since Jaguars get Woodsman I for free and barracks can give them Woodsman II off the bat, they are effectively 2 XP away from becoming the ultimate forest/jungle warriors of their time and effective medics. If you need to take out some enemy units that are fortified in a forest/jungle, especially those that are there to choke your cities, unleash the Woodsman III Jaguars. If you need some quick healing, you have Woodsman III Jaguars. A very handy support unit to have around for early warfare. They are probably still not such effective combat units on their own, but the first strikes might help.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can even maximise the Jaguar's healing ability by attaching a Great General to it and giving it all three Medic promotions as well. Woodsman III's healing stacks with the Medic promotions (provided they are on the same unit), giving you a whooping 50% healing rate. And this isn't difficult to achieve since Jaguars get free Combat I (required for Medic I) thanks to Aggressive, so you only need 26 XP to get there. Attaching a Great General to a unit gives you 20 XP, so that Jaguar effectively only needs 6 XP, the first 3 of which can be given by barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthage: Numidian Cavalry (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] This is a UU that people are divided about. Some regard it as a good UU (though not great). Others think it is weak. The latter opinion can usually be attributed to the traditional aversion to horse archers, Horseback Riding (HBR) and Archery (techs required to build horse archer-type units). Horse archers have two moves and are good for busting archer-defended cities, but they die to spearmen, rendering them easy to counter. Archery is widely viewed as a useless dead end tech early on, while HBR is fairly expensive, making it tempting to research other more beneficial techs first. The latter's beaker cost also makes it difficult to ensure that your opponents don't have spears yet by the time it's researched. Add the fact that horse archers suffer from a 10% penalty when attacking cities in Warlords, and that the Numidian Cavalry is 1 strength weaker than normal horse archers, it's easy to turn your back on the Carthaginian UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if you consider it carefully, you may find that it's actually worth something depending on the situation. In Warlords, HBR allows you to build stables (+2 exp to mounted units), which would give your horses an edge in promotions before Vassalage/Theocracy, making the tech more attractive to research early. And the Numidian Cavalry starts with Flanking I, so, with stables, you can give them Flanking II and another promotion (eg. Mobility) right off the bat. This would give them a 50% (20% natural ability + 30% from Flanking I and II) chance to withdraw from losing battles and, if you choose Mobility, the ability to more very quickly even in enemy territory. With the Charismatic trait, it's easy to get your Numidian Cavalry to the next level for yet another promotion. Don't forget that the free Flanking I would not disappear when you upgrade them to knights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those are not all. The Numidian Cavalry also gets 50% bonus vs. melee, as well as the 50% bonus vs. siege that horse archers have, making it virtually an improved axeman. It has no need to be overly afraid of spearmen, thanks to the melee bonus. And you can rely on Flanking II to increase the survival rate of your Numidian Cavalry when up against spears, or you can even the odds with Combat I and Shock. If there's no heavy cultural defense, Numidian Cavalry can do a decent job busting cities on their own, although you'll need a good number of them. As active empire defenders or counter units, they are versatile enough, having bonuses against two categories of units. As pillagers, they are excellent since spears, the easiest counter, are not as effective against them - just be sure to build stables and give them Combat I and Shock (of course, you may want a few Sentries). It may seem like a waste of their free Flanking I, but this way the enemy cannot easily drive your pillaging Numidians out. The few Flanking-promoted ones can attack enemy units guarding key resources. Remember to pillage ivory and horses first, since elephants and horse archers are the most effective counters to your UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cons of the Numidian Cavalry are their reduced strength, the 10% penalty against cities and the fact that they can't get City Raider promotions. Once there's significant cultural defense in an enemy city, expect to take huge losses if you don't bring siege weapons along. Even if there's no cultural defense and the city is not on a hill, Numidian Cavalry are actually not as strong as the city's unpromoted fortified archers, so you need to bring at least twice as many. You can beeline to HBR and rush a neighbour with a moderate stack of them to quickly capture a few cities, but don't expect them to carve out a large empire for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Horse archers no longer get the 10% city attack penalty, so the Numidian Archer is slightly stronger now. It also gains mounted units' flanking attack ability (not to be confused with Flanking promotion), whereby it does 'collateral damage' to siege units in the stack it is attacking, making it better at countering mass catapults than before. These changes certainly mean that Carthage players have something to cheer about.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Celtia: Gallic Warrior (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Gallic Warrior is a much-maligned UU. Most people wonder why an offensive unit is given a promotion for hill defense. How on earth is that going to help him attack cities, which is what it does best?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attacking a city is the culmination of an offensive movement, which begins with your entering enemy territory. If you're careful, you would want to move your stack along the safest route to the target city as far as possible, which often means favouring forests and hills over flatlands. This is where the Gallic Warrior's free Guerilla I can help. While spearmen protect your stack against mounted units and axemen/crossbows protect it from melee units, a Gallic Warrior on a hill is the best defender against counterattacking catapults and can even take over the role of the other stack-protection units. For example, if your spearman is badly injured, the Gallic Warrior can defend against chariots or horse archers as long as you're on a hill. Thus, while normal swordsmen may be badly injured before reaching the target city in these circumstances, chances are Gallic Warriors would be in better shape.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And note that Gallic Warriors can be promoted with Guerilla II and III. Such units can be a thorn in your enemy's side, running through the hills pillaging mines and maybe raiding a weakly defended city or two, thanks to Guerilla III's movement bonus on hills. The 25% bonus for attacks on hills and 30% withdrawal chance that this promotion gives also make it easier for you to deal with stubborn hill cities. And now that you can build Gallic Warriors with copper in the latest versions of Warlords, this UU can make an extra early appearance for city-busting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another neat thing about this UU is the fact that you can upgrade it to more advanced units in its line without losing the free Guerilla I. So, in effect, the benefit of this UU lasts for a long time. Remember that forests can be chopped but hills are permanent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Somewhat like the Jaguar, this UU benefits from an improvement to its natural promotion branch: the change to Guerrilla III. It still gives +25% hills attack but now it gives a 50% withdrawal chance, making a Guerilla III Gallic Warrior a very effective crack troop. Need to attack that fortified hilltop city before Construction? Guerilla III Gallic Warriors can soften the defenses and have a good chance of surviving even after losing. The 50% withdrawal chance really is quite amazing, outclassing both the Flanking promotions combined. Moreover, since both Celt leaders are Charismatic, it's really easy to get to Guerrilla III. With barracks, your Gallic Warriors can start with Guerilla II and you are only 1XP away from Guerilla III. Sounds like fun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]China: Chukonu (Crossbowman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu has a fearsome reputation. Collateral damage is something well-loved by most Civ4 players, and a respectable non-siege ground unit that has the ability to inflict it would surely become the favourite of some. The biggest weakness of siege units is their inability to defend effectively. The Chukonu, however, can function as an improved crossbowman, thus having an important benefit of siege units without the drawback.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may find it hard to pinpoint the exact role of this UU, though. Crossbows are primarily a counter unit, designed to help eliminate the threat of enemy melee units, and can in turn be countered by mounted units. If the enemy builds stacks of melee, your Chukonus will tear them apart with their bonus vs melee, first strikes and collateral damage. If the enemy mixes his stacks with mounted units, Chukonus are less effective. Thanks to collateral damage and the extra first strikes, however, they are much less helpless than normal crossbows and are still able to attack such mixed stacks, although you would probably sustain losses initially. The idea is to wear the enemy units down with your extra hits and collateral damage. Given enough Chukonus, there's almost nothing you can't defeat in the field (assuming you are facing units of the same era). But the question arises: Are they more cost effective for this purpose than catapults, since the latter are cheaper? If the enemy only has melee units then the answer is clearly yes. If the enemy has mounted units (which may be immune to first strikes) in his stack, sending in a few scuicide catapults first would probably be a better idea. The Chukonus can do semi-cleanup, dealing even more collateral damage to the enemy units and making them extremely weak and easy for more Chukonus or other units to take out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can apply the same concept when attacking a city. Siege units are still needed to remove the city's defenses, but who does the first few assaults would depend on what sort of units are defending the city. If they are macemen and pikemen/spearmen, use your Chukonus. If there are archery/mounted units in the city, use the siege units first, followed by the Chukonus and finally the cleanup crew (if you have any). Remember, Chukonus don't get City Raider promotions, so be prepared to lose some as they attack at lower odds than your CR units might have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chukonu's first strikes are useful on the offense, but they become the primary advantage on the defense. When Chukonus are defending, they won't get to inflict any collateral damage on the enemy units, but their first strikes would be a great boost. First strikes grant chances of hitting the enemy unit before the combat proper even begins, thus improving your odds. The stronger your unit is compared to the enemy's the better first strikes are, since the hits you score would do more damage, thus increasing the possibility of your unit winning without taking much damage. This makes them even better a defense against enemy melee units than normal crossbows. Their first strikes also work well when defending against siege weapons, since they might be able to win before much collateral damage is suffered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whether you give your Chukonus Drill promotions for more first strikes is up to you. Note that this UU has higher chances of being promoted than normal crossbowmen, since they are more suitable for an offensive role, making it possible to accumulate quite a few Drill promotions and a lot first strikes. Moreover, if you're playing on Warlords, both Chinese leaders are Protective, so Chukonus start with Drill I, giving you a headstart in that line of promotions. Gunpowder units can't choose Drill, so upgraded Chukonus can be interesting. Incidentally, Protective also makes the Chukonu better at defending cities, thanks to the free City Garrison I promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On a final note, here's a tip on how to get Chukonus early and really overrun your neighbours: Choose Qin Shi Huang as your leader and aim to build the Oracle to grab Metal Casting (requires Pottery and Bronze Working). The Industrious trait makes getting the Oracle viable, even without marble. Metal Casting leads to Machinery, but it also allows you to build your cheap Industrious forges. Build one asap and run an engineer specialist. When a Great Engineer is born, use him to lightbulb Machinery, giving you access to the Chinese UU very early. But do note that Machinery requires Iron Working and Chukonus need the iron resource to be built, so make sure you get this tech researched while waiting for the GE to be born. The worst scenario is finding no iron in your territory. To help prevent this situation, research Iron Working as quickly as possible to locate iron resources and claim them if necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Egypt: War Chariot (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At 5 strength, the Egyptian War Chariot is essentially an axeman on wheels with no City Raider promotions but has withdrawal chance. It is a very powerful and mobile unit that can win your game from as early as the Ancient Era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An Egyptian player who does not have copper has less to worry about. In fact, horses are much more important for him/her, making Animal Husbandry (AH) a priority. And since Egypt starts with Agriculture, which leads to AH, things are pretty much set up for you. Egypt also starts with The Wheel, which is required to build chariots and roads (to hook up those horses). What serendipity! Feel free to delay Bronze Working till you wish to use Slavery, unless it turns out that there are no horses within reasonable distance. If you discover horses nearby, get a settler there as soon as possible and hook it up. You can then begin preparing for your offensive. Chariot rushing has never been so effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the chariot rush tactic of pillaging the enemy's metal mines should still be applied, War Chariots aren't as afraid of spears as normal chariots because of their increased strength. Additionally, you can give them the Shock promotion to help deal with enemy spears that you might encounter. This would also help vanilla players who face enemy axemen, since the chariot bonus vs. axes applies only after Warlords (vanilla players are somewhat compensated by having 20% withdrawal chance instead of just 10%, though). That said, I have found Flanking promotions a generally better choice when up against spears. Even with Shock, War Chariots have lower odds of winning, so you might as well increase their survival rate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A little later in the game, a combination of War Chariots and axes would be good to guard against counterattacking spears, since War Chariots don't get defensive bonuses and would almost certainly lose all the time. In most games, axes (and maybe swords) would gradually replace them as the premier city raiders anyway. As enemy cities accumulate more defensive ratings, those spears become more and more costly to dislodge with War Chariots alone. The loss in mobility that would result from this handing over is usually nothing to worry about, since it corresponds roughly to the time when you need to expand at a slower pace until you can get upkeep costs down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Speaking of upkeep, be wary of over-expanding with War Chariots. It's easy to fall into this trap since they pack a good punch so early in the game. While judicious use of them might mean smooth sailing for the rest of the game, their careless use can ruin you as you fall hopelessly behind in terms of technology and development paying upkeep, especially on the higher levels. This and the lack of close neighbours are the greatest early adversaries of the Egyptian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]England: Redcoat (Rifleman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The terror of your enemies in Civ4 vanilla, this unit is dramatically different in Warlords. In the former, it has 16 strength compared to the normal rifleman's 14 and an additional 25% bonus vs. gunpowder units. Hence, they are uber powerful in their era, quite unmatched by any other unit until infantry. The use of the Redcoat on vanilla is, therefore, quite straightforward. Build lots of them and/or upgrade your CR units to them and go on the offensive. Combine them with cannons for even greater effect and watch the colours on the minimap change rapidly. Even grenadiers are unable to counter them effectively due to their additional bonus. The only way the enemy can really fight back is by throwing lots of cannons at them, but you can always spread your stacks out, and the AI isn't likely to do that anyway. Don't let the enemy get machine guns, though. These are a sure counter to Redcoats on the defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, however, it's not so easy. Redcoats have the same base strength as normal riflemen. They only retain their bonus vs. gunpowder units. That said, they are still quite effective. Given no terrain or promotion-based bonuses, no unit of the same era can beat them when they attack. They are vulnerable to attacks by enemy grenadiers now, but still not as badly as in the case of normal riflemen. They own any other unit when defending. You can still use this UU the same way, but more careful planning is required. A proper defense against enemy grenadiers must now be provided for, and cannons play a greater role. Do note that Redcoats have no advantage over normal rifles when attacking cities defended by longbows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Warlords, you must consider the Churchill factor as well. The new English leader is Charismatic and Protective, making his gunpowder units especially effective. They start with City Garrison I and Drill I and require fewer xp points get promoted. As city defenders, Churchill's Redcoats are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are also better on the offensive, since Drill helps in any combat situation and, thanks to the free City Garrison, you can better defend newly captured cities against enemy counterattacks. Some players even consider Churchill part of the reason why Redcoats had to be nerfed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A final point on this UU: Drill IV Redcoats are formidable. They get a total of 5 first strikes and a chance at another (immunity from first strikes are rare enough post-Gunpowder), an extra 10% bonus vs. mounted units and an amazing 60% reduction of any collateral damage sustained. These units are likely to take less damage in every way and win more often. And, in Warlords, Drill counts as a prerequisite promotion towards Cover, Formation and other "vs unit type" promotions. Hence, units with Drill are not condemned by not choosing Combat, should the need for those promotions arise. Especially valuable is the availability of Pinch as a promotion, since it helps to neutralise the threat of attacking grenadiers. The trouble is gunpowder (and melee) units don't get Drill promotions, so it's only possible to create such units by upgrading your archery units to Redcoats, which requires you to set aside a tidy sum. To make matters worse, archery units are generally not used offensively and are thus difficult to promote. However, the good news is Churchill players can do this more easily. With the Protective trait giving free Drill I to your archery units and Charismatic making promotions easier to obtain, you can use crossbows (the most likely candidate, since it has greater offensive value compared to archers and longbows) extensively in the hopes of getting some of them up to Drill IV to be upgraded later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Redcoat has indirectly been improved from its Warlords version since all gunpowder units can now receive Drill promotions. That means elite Drill Redcoats are much closer to reality, especially for Churchill. Gone are the days when you have to upgrade archery units to get them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ethiopia: Oromo Warrior (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Musket UUs generally don't get a lot of love, although the ones that the game has to offer are actually quite useful. But even if you're really not a fan of musket UUs, give the Oromo Warrior a try before you knock it. It is immune to First Strikes and starts with Drill I and II promotions; that means 2-3 First Strikes and -20% to collateral damage received out of the box. And if you throw the experience from barracks in, you get Drill III Oromo Warriors straight off the assembly line. Just add in Theocracy/Vassalage or a military instructor and you can be training Drill IV Oromos. Naturally, this UU has a potentially high survival rate, even after being battered by siege weapons (thanks to the Drill promotions' protection against collateral damage of up to 60%). They will perform normal muskets' defensive role extra well, and you need not be so hesitant about using them to attack even when faced with knights. Longbows are also less of a worry since Oromos are immune to First Strikes. Moreover, they are draftable, and you can get Drill III draftees with just Theocracy/Vassalage/a military instructor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If those aren't enough, you needn't worry so much about this musket UU getting obsolete quickly (BTS has delayed the advent of grenadiers to prolong the life of muskets anyway) because the promotions will remain on them when they are upgraded to riflemen. You might have read about the elusive elite Drill IV Redcoats. Well, with Ethiopia, Drill IV riflemen are a lot easier to come by. Suddenly those enemy cannons are not so scary anymore, are they?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]France: Musketeer (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they are 1 strength point weaker than knights, musketmen have no hard counter in their time, which is the whole point of this unit. Also, knights don't get defensive bonuses so they are not as good at defending. Musketmen fare well as an all-round stack protector. And when one of your cities is threatened, wouldn't it be ideal to have a versatile defender that can counterattack as well? Remember that musketmen can be drafted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, think of the potential uses of Musketeers, which are musketmen with 2 moves. They can reinforce any threatened city quickly, which makes them potentially more effective as city defenders than longbowmen. And when you need stack protection during a campaign, Musketeers, besides being an insurance that covers you against everything except knights and Pinch elephants (both of which you can simply counter by bringing pikes), are also able to pillage along the way with the extra move (which can be useful for taking out strategic resources). Not just that, their speed means you can have reserves catching up with your stack to take over the role of their wounded comrades should your stack come under attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Offensively, they have their uses as well. Musketeers can do clean-up work when all your siege weapons and CR units have spent their move attacking, since they have 9 base strength and aren't countered by any particular unit. And, of course, they are great for a pillaging campaign. Mix them with pikemen in small stacks and they can move and pillage within a single turn and with near impunity. Versatility is the name of the Musketeer game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A major gripe that people have about this UU is the fact that it obsoletes too quickly, since Chemistry is effectively only a few techs away. Moreover, nothing upgrades to muskets and you have to build them from scratch, further narrowing their window of opportunity. The Musketeers' speed actually helps to alleviate this problem, since you can get them to the frontline to be used a lot more quickly compared to normal musketmen. Also, researching Nationalism and switching to Nationhood to draft can help you get enough of them out in time to be used to full effect. You can stay in Nationhood and research towards Rifling next, so that you can soon start drafting riflemen to complete your offensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this note, there's another interesting use for Musketeers. Try postponing Chemistry and beelining to Military Tradition for early cavalry. Research techs along the Education route, be the first to get Liberalism and grab Nationalism as the free tech. Then research Gunpowder (which is also needed for cavalry), start drafting/building Musketeers (you may use them first if you want), research Military Tradition (requires Music, which you should trade for) and start building cavalry. Escort your cavalry with Musketeers and either launch a lightning campaign or pillage with impunity. Only Musketeers can keep up with cavalry while protecting them against costly counterattacks by enemy pikes. Flanking cavalry often prevail against longbow-defended cities by themselves with relatively low casualty rates, so even if you plan on taking cities, there might not be a need to bring slow siege weapons along. If you do this right, you can finish off one or two neighbours just like that, before they can build riflemen to counter your cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Germany: Panzer (Tank)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite being the latest UU in the game, the Panzer really packs a punch. A tank with 50% bonus versus armour units, it will eat other tanks alive and beat even modern armour. This gives them the power to dominate the battlefield. Just watch out for those gunships, which are an effective counter to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you get Panzers before the enemy gets Flight, you can solve this problem by beelining for enemy oil wells and pillaging them to prevent him/her from building a single gunship in the first place. This should be relatively easy to do, since the enemy can't stop you with his/her own tanks. Once that is done, you'd be facing mostly gunpowder units, against which the Pinch promotion would be effective in the field. With it, the Panzer can match even mech infantry, unless the latter is better promoted or is receiving defensive bonuses. And with the free Blitz promotion that tanks have, a stack of Panzers can annihilate up to double the number units in a turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When taking cities, the Panzer might only be as effective as a normal tank, since you are likely to face many gunpowder units, which receive defensive bonuses unlike armour units. But that is alright, since tanks are excellent at taking cities anyway, having access to both Barrage and City Raider promotions. After you've chewed through the toughest defenders, whatever armour is sitting in the city would be easy pickings. Apply the blitzkrieg strategy by using your bombers to soften city defenses before rapidly moving in with your City Raider Panzers. Be sure to have some Drill Panzers to clean up, since they are good at taking out the weaker units without suffering much damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem with this UU is how late it appears. It is enabled by Industrialism but requires oil, which means you have to get Combustion and build oil wells in addition to it, placing it even later in the timeline than Navy SEALs. Many players would have won the game by then, or at least they would be in such dominant or winning positions that having Panzers would have little influence on the outcome. Once you get them, however, they can last till the end of the game. Their ability to stand up to modern armour means you can delay getting Composites and survive without aluminum. Even if modern armour is already available, you would probably want to leave some of your Panzers un-upgraded as a versatile counter to enemy armour. Of course, you must have oil to build Panzers in the first place. Being German and not having oil in the later eras in a tightly contested game would be a shame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greece: Phalanx (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx, derided by some, is in fact one of the stronger UUs in the game. With 5 strength and +25% hill defense (not to be confused with free Guerilla promotion), it has enough qualities to set it far above normal spearmen. Don't forget that it also gets free Combat I from Alexander's Aggressive trait.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phalanx is essentially a super spearman. However, if you build them early enough in single player, chances are the AI might not have anything except archers. Thus, it would do just as well as the axeman when used as a rush unit, except that it holds the ground better on hills and isn't afraid of Warlords' chariots (which get +100% attack vs. axemen). The fact that the Greeks start with Hunting (which is required to build the UU) certainly helps if you are thinking of rushing with it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In its conventional role, the Phalanx also boasts a very long lifespan of more than two eras. Elephants give normal spearmen cause to worry, while knights are too strong be countered well by them. Phalangites, however, are able to counter elephants effectively and hold their own against knights. When they are defending on hills, no mounted unit before cavalry can beat them one-on-one without having at least the Shock promotion (perhaps with the exception of the melee-busting Conquistadors). They are also good at defending on hills, especially in hill cities, against most units in the Ancient and Classical eras. A truly solid package for a UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] The Phalanx has, for better or worse, been changed in BTS. It is now an axeman that is not vulnerable to chariots. That means chariots do not get a 100% bonus when attacking them. This effectively transforms a defensive UU into an offensive one, as Greek players need not worry about having to protect their earliest city raiding units from chariots. If you are the kind of player who says the glass is half empty, this change at most saves you from having to build a few spearmen and to research Hunting before you begin an axe rush. But if you like to say the glass is half full, this makes a strong rush unit that is exactly like the axeman in vanilla, which can only be countered by another axeman. Indeed, saving you the effort of building spearmen can be crucial in the early game, when cities are few and hammers are scarce. It can mean a few extra Phalanxes, which might decide whether you can take and hold a (or an extra) city or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the defense, the new Phalanx also performs decently in the early game. Now you don't have to build spearmen to deal with the occasional pillaging chariot, though of course spears would be more effective. Not having to build spearmen might also mean having extra Phalanxes to defend against an enemy axe rush. You might prefer the old version of this UU, but you can't say the new one isn't useful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Inca: Quechua (Warrior)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dubbed by some as one of the worst UUs when Civ4 was still new, the Quechua has gained notoriety through the Quechua rush, a strategy that might win you a Deity game even if it's far above your current skill level. How is that possible, you ask? Quechuas are cheap at 15 hammers each (cheaper than half an axeman) and they get a 100% bonus against archers, the AI's primary/only city garrison unit early in the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush is simple to do. You can probably start building Quechuas in the beginning and overwhelm the nearest AI capital with numbers (provided you've located it, of course). However, it's advisable that you build a worker, barracks and another worker first. The first worker would improve food resources (for whipping), build mines and chop trees, while the second would start building a road to the nearest AI capital (which, presumably, you would have found by then) and make logistics less of a nightmare. The barracks allows your capital to grow in between the worker builds, but, more importantly, it allows you to build Quechuas with Cover. In vanilla, Huayna Capac is Aggressive and hence Quechuas get Combat I free, allowing you to promote them with Cover immediately if you've built a barracks. Even though the Inca leader is no longer Aggressive in Warlords, Quechuas still get Combat I free, so this tactic still applies. Quechuas with Cover have a much higher chance of winning against fortified archers so you don't need as many of them. You would be able to capture one AI city after another much more quickly. This method also has the benefit of allowing the AIs to settle more cities before you attack, thus giving you early game expansion possibilities without having to build your own settlers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have the workers and barracks (and have researched Mining and Bronze Working), you can start building, chopping or whipping Quechuas out. If copper is discovered within your territory, you can supplement your rush with axemen, who can gradually take over as your main city raiders, ensuring that your offensive is longer-lasting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This rush does have its limitations. It requires a close neighbour. Otherwise, it would take too long to get there and you would have to pay an unreasonable amount of distance upkeep if you succeed in capturing the city. Of course, you can resort to razing, but this strategy would then lose half its value. It also assumes that the AI builds archers to defend itself. On that note, you need to be playing at a high enough difficulty, where the AI can either build archers immediately or soon enough. Warriors might be too cost-effective for Quechuas to be facing, even though you can choose the Shock promotion instead of Cover. A higher difficulty level also means the AI is likely to start with a free settler or two and would thus have more cities up for grabs when you begin your rush. The AI may also conveniently choose to settle his cities towards you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The downside to this rush is the relatively high amount of unit upkeep that you have to pay early in the game. Coupled with the distance maintenance you have to pay for captured cities, your early technological development might be retarded for a while. You can, however, count on being able to catch up fairly quickly if you've nabbed an especially powerful neighbouring capital. Huayna's Financial trait can also help you recover more quickly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond this strategy, the Quechua's usefulness is quite limited. They are effective against barbarians, since those often take the form of archers, and would hence perform well under raging barbs setting. They are also better than normal warriors at worker stealing (since they survive better against archers), should you choose to be aggressive from the start even though you have no plans of capturing enemy cities yet. Besides these, it's hard to conceive of another way to exploit this UU without rushing, making it rather situational. It either shines or fades into relative oblivion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]India: Fast Worker (Worker)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Fast Worker is a worker with 3 moves (which, interestingly enough, is unmatched till gunships in the modern age). This means, with all their moves unspent, they can enter forest/jungle/hill and immediately begin improving the tile without ending their turn. However, they do end their turn if they enter a forested/jungled hill.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indirectly, this means the Fast Worker is faster at doing what workers do. It does not improve tiles faster, but being able to begin earlier in many situations would translate to a lot of saved worker turns by the end of the game. By the way, yes, it is the only UU that lasts throughout the game. Their extra movement also means they are able to cover distances more quickly, allowing you to move them around your empire efficiently. This enables a much tighter worker strategy, where you can have fewer workers improving tiles in different cities according to which city would grow and work the tiles next. To put it simply, playing as India, you do not need as many workers to develop your land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To get the most out of this UU, adopt an early worker strategy (i.e. building a worker first). You'd develop much quicker than the other civs and could use this early game lead to your advantage for the rest of the game. Their 3 moves also make them excellent scouts, especially early on when revealing your surroundings quickly is crucial. Just make sure you keep them away from animals and barbs. With their speed, it shouldn't be that difficult.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some players do not like the fact that it is not a military UU, but few would be able to argue against its merits. The only downside to the Fast Worker is the fact that slower game speeds diminish their advantage, since the turns saved by their extra movement would be less and less significant compared to the increased number turns needed to improve tiles. If you're playing on Quick or Normal speed, this UU is certainly amazing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Japan: Samurai (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cool factor aside, there seems to be little that is interesting about this UU at first glance. It is a regular maceman that cannot be built with copper (requiring specifically iron) and has 2 first strikes. The second thing is what gives the Samurai its power, and which has sparked considerable debate on how useful it makes this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After much testing and debate, it is generally agreed that the 2 first strikes are a great boon. They help the Samurai survive, even at lower odds, and give them an edge against archers and longbows, the primary city defenders of the day. First strikes essentially mean that the unit gets the chance to inflict damage on the enemy unit even before the combat proper begins. Both archers and longbows get 1 first strike, which help them deal with regular city attackers (i.e. units with access to City Raider promotions, such as macemen), but have this advantage cancelled out by one of the Samurai's first strikes. And the Samurai still has another first strike to use. This also applies to crossbowmen (who also get 1 first strike), making the Samurai less vulnerable to that effective anti-melee unit. And, just as importantly, this advantage also has the effect of giving Samurais a higher chance to win battles while suffering less damage. That means they are potentially able to recover faster for another attack, thereby shortening the length of the Japanese player's campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But do take note that this bonus is not the same as getting free Drill promotions (to which, by the way, macemen do not have access). It is better than merely a free Drill I, but it will not remain when you upgrade your Samurais. And beware of knights (especially Conquistadors or those with Shock promotion). They are a fast and effective counter to Samurai, since they have enough strength and ignore first strikes, so bring enough pikemen when facing a sufficiently advanced opponent who has researched Guilds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawback of the Samurai is the requirement of iron. While regular macemen can be built with copper as well, without iron, the Japanese player will be stuck without his/her UU or even regular macemen. Thankfully, this strategic resource is quite commonly available. But if you do find yourself not having one readily available, planting a city in the tundra or invading your neighbour to get it might be worth the effort before the age of the Samurai arrives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Korea: Hwacha (Catapult)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] If you like axemen, you'd love the Hwacha. It is a catapult with 50% bonus vs melee units, making it an axeman with collateral damage, bombard ability and withdrawal chance for a mere five hammers more (Normal speed). The only downside is the Hwacha doesn't receive defensive bonuses like an axeman, so you might want to use your Hwachas offensively and turn up the heat so the enemy is forced to defend in his nice cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hwacha has some interesting synergy with Wang Kon's Protective trait. Protective really shines when you have no metals and are forced to adopt a defensive position with archers in the early game. Construction represents the departure from such a stance, since you're now able to build catapults and attack. Hwachas, being super catapults, puts you in an even better position to go on the offensive, with Protective archers/longbows for support as defenders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you have iron, Protective crossbows and spears/pikes are perfect companions to Hwachas. They eliminate the threat of enemy melee and mounted units and help defend new possessions while your Hwachas take down enemy defenders. You don't need axemen. A few swords to help clean up can complete your arsenal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When macemen and trebuchets come into the picture, Hwachas gradually take a back seat, but not before you can deal some serious damage to a neighbour or two. Nonetheless, a Korean player would benefit from picking up Construction as quickly as possible. Why not put this powerful weapon into use as early as you can? And Wang Kon's Financial trait can certainly help with that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]For BTS players:[\BOLD] Unfortunately, as it stands, the Hwacha has been weakened by the inability of siege weapons to kill units and to gain more than 1 experience point per battle. Its bonus still applies, but you can no longer rely on a stack of Hwachas to actually capture cities for you. You also need enough units to kill off all the weakened defenders. While this job can be done by almost any non-siege unit, this means hammers probably need to be diverted to other units, resulting in fewer Hwachas built. Then there's the 1xp only rule, which is worse since it means your Hwachas can no longer gain valuable additional promotions through combat, making it less effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The impact of this UU has certainly been reduced. You can still make good use of it much in the same way as before, but remember to build more units for clean up duty and to take up the slack caused by fewer veteran Hwachas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mali: Skirmisher (Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skirmishers are archers with 4 strength and 1 extra first strike chance, effectively making Mali half a Protective civ until Feudalism comes around. With them, Malinese cities are certainly not ones to be taken easily in the early game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The normal use of Skirmishers is pretty straight forward: Defend your cities or hill improvements with them. As such, they play a rather passive role as a UU. This puts into question the rationale of going straight for Archery, even when playing Mali. First, you don't start with Hunting (required for Archery). Second, the threat of barbarian or enemy axes make axemen a better unit for defense, since they are able to counterattack and prevent your improvements from being pillaged. Lastly, Bronze Working is needed for Slavery anyway, and if you happen to find copper nearby after researching it you can soon build axes. Skirmishers can help with defense if you don't find copper around, but in that case you might want to beeline to Iron Working, so Hunting and Archery are still not the priority. But of course, in the worst case scenario where you find no metal around, Skirmishers can become quite important.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords improves Skirmishers a little by making chariots a counter to axes. Now you don't have to fear barbarian/enemy axemen if you don't have copper but have horses. Barb spearmen, if they do appear, can be countered somewhat by Skirmishers. You can thus concentrate on teching up with chariots and Skirmishers for defense, without having to beeline for the relatively expensive Iron Working. If you want to be aggressive, you can rush a neighbour with a stack of chariots and some Skirmishers. The latter can help secure newly conquered cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now for the less conventional. If you are going for a really quick rush as Mali, you can beeline to Archery from the beginning. Skirmishers don't require resources, so you can technically rush a neighbour with them Jaguar-style. Get Archery as quickly as possible, build barracks - maybe settle a second city - and start building Skirmishers. After you several of them, rush the nearest neighbour's capital. Skirmishers are better than normal archers, so with a ratio of about 3:1 in your favour, you may be able to overwhelm the defending archers. The surviving Skirmishers would then help you hold on to the conquered city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you whip to rush build Skirmishers for this tactic, becareful of the hammer overflow. You might quickly begin to whip them out for one population point each and run into serious happiness issues. If you want to try this rush, you should have a food-plenty and hilly area (i.e. a good production city site) as the site of your capital. You'll need the hammers because you'll be building most of the Skirmishers the slow way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mongolia: Keshik (Horse Archer)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keshiks are horse archers that ignore terrain movement cost and get 1 first strike, but aren't immune to first strikes. Hence, they are extremely adept at raiding and pillaging, but aren't as good at attacking archers/longbows with Drill promotions. This has a few implications on a Mongolian player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surprise is the best asset of the Keshiks. Ignoring terrain movement cost means they can traverse forests/jungles and hills as easily as flatlands. Thus, it is easy for a Mongolian player to strike across difficult terrain at the unlikeliest of places, grabbing unguarded workers and lightly-defended cities or pillaging improvements (especially on strategic resources). However, this advantage relies on the enemy's inability to counterattack immediately with spearmen or a superior force, so good intelligence would be needed to know where exactly the enemy places his spears and the bulk of his units. If you do not have this luxury, you could always send more Keshiks in case you meet spears, but be prepared to lose quite a few of them. In addition, you could pillage enemy roads to eventually cripple his ability to counterattack. However, at the end of the day, the strategic advantage you gain from your harassment must outweigh the lost hammers you spent on the dead Keshiks[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Keshiks' first strike, meanwhile, makes them better than normal horse archers at picking off non-spear units in your territory or in the enemy's. Combined with their terrain movement advantage, this makes them good empire defenders and hit-and-run units. Unfortunately, the enemy can easily counter them by having spearmen guard his units, so this might only work effectively against the AI. There's also a limitation on how good Keshiks are in fighting non-spear units compared to normal horse archers. The immunity to first strikes that normal horse archers get makes them better at fighting archery units with Drill promotions or units with Drill III/IV. The Keshiks' own first strike can only negate one of the enemy units' first strikes. To remedy this, you have to give your Keshiks Flanking II so that they get immunity to first strikes as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This, in turn, highlights the Keshik's relative weakness (compared to normal horse archers) in attacking cities defended by Drill-promoted archery units. In Warlords, this means Protective civs are better covered against attempts to take cities with Keshiks. The 10% city attack penalty that the horse archer unit-type gets in Warlords makes them even less desirable as city raiders. Thus, the only hope Mongolian player might have in using Keshiks to conquer in Warlords is to rely on speed, Flanking promotions and numbers (also applies to vanilla, but not to such a large extent).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With barracks and Ger in the city, a Keshik gets 7 xp upon being built. Unfortunately, that will still allow for only 2 initial promotions (unless you're running both Vassalage and Theocracy for a total of 11 xp), though of course your mounted units would be promoted to the next level sooner. But, at any rate, 2 initial promotions are good enough. Give most of the Keshiks Flanking I and II to give them 50% withdrawal chance each (including the natural 20%) and immunity to first strikes. Give Combat I and Medic I or Combat I and Shock (for defending against spearmen) to the rest. Have at least one Medic I Keshik and one Shock Keshik in each stack. If you get Compass early enough, you can use explorers (strength 4, ignores terrain movement cost and starts with free Guerilla I and Woodsman I) to help protect your stacks when they stop on hills or forests/jungles. 3 or 4 cities with Gers pumping out Keshiks would usually be good enough to amass a sizeable army in reasonable time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As your Keshiks attack enemy cities, some will die, some will withdraw and some will win. The medics will ensure that the withdrawing and winning Keshiks heal up more quickly. If you manage to overwhelm a prepared enemy with numbers, your speed advantage (from ignoring terrain movement cost and faster healing) will ensure that the enemy cannot fight back or resist as effectively, hastening his destruction. If the enemy is unprepared in the first place, your speed advantage will ensure his quick defeat. Note that this strategy can only work if the enemy doesn't have longbows yet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You should be prepared to build courthouses and marketplaces to help you keep your winnings. But even if you're not, you can just resort to razing and pillaging for some barbaric fun. Long live the Golden Horde![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Netherlands: East Indiaman (Galleon)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]BTS only.[\BOLD] Now here's an interesting UU. Although it does have some combat capability, it serves primarily as a support unit. But the East Indiaman is pretty good at it, offering an extra cargo space for a total of 4, which is quite a big leap from a normal galleon considering the fact that transports have the same capacity. If you're planning on waging war during the age of the rifle, especially against an overseas civ, or if you are planning a large-scale settling another landmass, you don't have to build quite as many ships to carry your units over. Three East Indiamen carry as much as four galleons, thereby saving you 80 hammers, which can almost make an extra frigate (90 hammers) to protect your fleet. Moreover, since they carry as many units as transports, you might not need to decommission or upgrade them till the end of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The East Indiaman also has the nifty ability to travel within rival borders without needing an open borders treaty. Have you accumulated much EPs thanks to the Financial trait? You can send your spies anywhere in the world conveniently, even directly into an unfriendly overseas civ. And the extra cargo space is useful for espionage as well, helping you keep a constant flow of spies even if many get caught.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly, the East Indiaman has 2 more strength than a normal galleon, making it tougher to sink. While it still can't beat a frigate, it can more than annihilate caravels and destroy other galleons, so you have naval superiority at Astronomy until your rivals get Chemistry and build frigates. And, should there be privateers prowling the seas, you needn't worry so much about being ambushed by them while moving units across water without escort during peacetime. This is probably a UU that you would appreciate on maps with lots of seas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ottomans: Janissary (Musketman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] The Janissary's advantage is a 25% boost against melee, archery and mounted units, making it a great all-round unit for its time. It is pretty much effective against all previous era units (with the big exception of siege units), so you can potentially put some serious hurt in your enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to get as much use out of Janissaries as possible, you need to look for ways to get to Gunpowder early. You might even want to make a beeline for it, either through the northern path (Maths -&gt; Currency -&gt; Priesthood? -&gt; Civil Service -&gt; Paper -&gt; Education) or the southern path (Metal Casting -&gt; Machinery &amp; Monotheism -&gt; Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guilds) in the tech tree. Different lightbulbing strategies are available (with Great Merchants for the southern path and Great Scientists for the northern one), so you don't have to self-research everything. Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to do a beeline, but it's probably the best way. The point is to get to Gunpowder before your enemies are even close to it, and rapidly exploiting this opportunity gap by building, whipping and possibly drafting as many Janissaries as you can to use against them. To be able to draft, you would need to pursue the northern path and probably research Liberalism first to grab Nationalism as the free tech, before actually researching Gunpowder. It is a slight diversion, but it may be worth the delay if your empire does not have the capability to build or whip enough Janissaries in time to give you a real edge, as often is the case.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once you have them, Janissaries are quite a fearsome force in the medieval battlefield. They have no hard counter, so the best bet your enemies might have is to promote their units with Pinch, which requires Gunpowder in Warlords. Knights with Pinch, however, are a good counter to Jannissaries, as are regular musketmen (against whom Janissaries have no advantage whatsoever), so once your enemies have Gunpowder as well you may find your edge disappearing. If they manage to get to Chemistry, which isn't that far away, this UU is practically obsolete. Janissary stacks are actually relatively vulnerable to siege units (and the associated collateral damage) as well, since they don't get any bonuses against these. But unless you're playing MP, this shouldn't be a big problem. The AI does not generally build many catapults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also take note that Janissaries may not be the best city-taking troops you can get, since they do not have access to City Raider promotions. Needless to say, if you're relying on them as the backbone of your army, you still need to bring siege weapons along if you hope to grab some enemy territory. Given the fact that they are not actually very different from the conduct of normal campaigns of the time, Janissary campaigns might still be slow going, so don't be surprised if you don't manage to knock out more than one enemy with them, even with your best efforts (assuming you're playing on the higher levels). Hence, the emphasis is again on getting them as early as possible so as to enlarge the window of opportunity that you have.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Overall, without the mobility of the Musketeer, this UU is quite situational and, to an even higher degree than the former, requires some long term planning in the early game to be put to good use. It is probably better the lower the difficulty you play on, since you would be more likely to out-tech the AIs and get to Gunpowder much earlier than them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Persia: Immortal (Chariot)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It seems odd that Immortals are chariot-replacements, and you may miss the ownage days of playing as Persia with their Civ3 incarnation. Fortunately, they are still very effective in Civ4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you have horses and a neighbouring civ nearby, you know you're in for some fun. Immortals get 50% bonus vs. archery units, as well as an innate 30% withdrawal chance. No AI I've seen can resist them very early in the game. Hook up those horses quickly, build/whip out some of these creatures and head straight for the neighbour. If you managed to build barracks, you can give them Flanking I for an extra 10% withdrawal chance. If you have time to kill some barbs as well, before heading for your neighbour's cities, you can promote some with Flanking II for immunity against first strikes and a total of 60% withdrawal chance. This would give them a high survival rate against archers. Don't they sound like excellent AI city busters? What's more, they do get defensive bonuses, making them less vulnerable to counterattack and decent garrison units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If or when your enemy gets spearmen, however, Immortals lose much of their power. Even one spearman in a city you're attacking can give you a lot of trouble. You really have to count on the withdrawal chances if you want the first few Immortals to survive a direct attack on the city. In Civ4 vanilla, enemy axemen would be a problem too, since chariots don't get the 50% bonus when attacking axemen like in Warlords. To help prevent difficulties from arising, you should pillage any AI mine that you see sitting on a metal resource. If a city is on top of one, pillage the roads around it to limit spear production to that city. You would thus prolong the effectiveness of your Immortals. Until your enemy gets Feudalism, that is. If he can. Although the 50% bonus also applies when fighting longbows, the latter are too strong when defending in cities to be dislodged by Immortals alone. The same may be said of enemy crossbows. But with the help of siege weapons, Immortals can still take them down quite easily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The biggest problem is when there is no neighbour near you. In that case, you can't use Immortals to their full potential. However, they are still quite handy against barbs, since the latter usually take the form of archers. In Warlords, they are also great for dispatching barb axemen. Clearly, the expansion has given this solid UU even more oomph.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Rome: Praetorian (Swordsman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians are a blunt instrument with which you can rule the early battlefield. Taking cities is the name of the game, and Praetorians easily destroy enemy archers defending cities (even those with some cultural defense), with odds so favorable that they'll likely not suffer losses. You may lose a few if the enemy city is on a hill and the defender has City Garrison promotions, but the odds will still favor you most of the time. You probably want to give your Praetorians City Raider (CR) promotions to help bust those cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because of their high strength, Praetorians can hold their own against axeman, their natural counter. Nevertheless, it may be best to build your own axemen or promote a few Praetorians with Combat I and Shock for stack defense. Praetorians will also prevail against mounted units of the same era, though a spearman or two will only do you good, leaving your Praetorians to focus on taking those cities. After the enemy gets longbowmen, the Praetorian is still useful, but you need to support them with catapults to remove city defenses and soften up the defenders to avoid catastrophic losses. Watch out for crossbows, though; they are very effective against Praetorians. The best way to guard against them is to pillage the enemy's iron mines before he/she can build them. The same goes for enemy Shock war elephants, in which case you should pillage his/her ivory camps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Praetorians require Iron Working and iron. A Roman player would probably want to take advantage of the Praetorian as early as possible, so beelining to Iron Working is a good call. You may want to have a settler and some workers ready to exploit any iron deposit you see as soon as the tech is researched, although there's some chance that you'd find iron within your existing borders. You should also build barracks first, so that you can give your Praetorians a promotion from the get go, whether it is CR 1 for city busting or Combat 1 for Shock later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The problem with Praetorians is the Roman player may become a victim of his own success. Because it is so easy to expand quickly with this UU, the temptation to expand beyond your limit is great. You may end up too many cities, causing your economy to crash from the upkeep. One solution is to raze cities rather than keep them, unless they are close to yours or have high value (eg. capitals, holy cities or those with wonders). This also has the effect of severely weakening or even eliminating your enemies so it is easier to actually expand when your economy is able to support it later. And, while you're doing this, do pillage the improvements around razed cities to set your enemies back even further and for extra funds. You can also help yourself by building up your infrastructure at home to support your campaigns, such as laying down lots of cottages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This UU is the main reason why it's good to play as Rome when you're new on a difficulty level. Try not to get too used to having them, though, as you might become too dependent on their strength to play with any other civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Russia: Cossack (Cavalry)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the Redcoat, the Cossack is one UU that has been changed in Warlords. In Civ IV vanilla, the Cossack has a fearsome reputation. A cavalry with 18 strength and +50% against mounted units on top of the ordinary cavalry capabilities (+50% against cannon and 30% withdrawal chance), it can beat almost every unit in its era. Even riflemen, its counter, have less strength if you don't consider promotions or defensive bonuses. Pinch-promoted Cossacks can eat them alive. Riflemen need to be one level higher (4) and get the Formation promotion to even out the playing field, though you should note that Aggressive riflemen can get Formation at level 3. Redcoats do counter Cossacks very well, but Cossacks are faster, can withdraw and aren't destroyed by machine guns and massed cannons the way Redcoats are.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you are using them in the vanilla game, consider getting them as early as possible by beelining to Education, getting Liberalism and choosing Nationalism as the free tech. Nationalism leads to Military Tradition (requires Music, so make sure you trade for it) and Education leads to Gunpowder, techs needed to build Cossacks (and you must have horses, of course). If you pull this off early enough, the rest of the game should be easy - Cossacks versus longbowmen is no contest. You can shoot for a domination victory right away. All you need to do is keep pumping out Cossacks, with the whip whenever possible, while ideally running the military civics (Vassalage and Theocracy) to give your Cossacks an even bigger edge. It's no wonder that some people consider them overpowered in vanilla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords, however, is a vastly different game for Cossack fans. On one hand, there's the introduction of the stable, which improves mounted units by giving them 2 more experience points. On the other hand, the Cossack has the same strength as normal cavalry now, only retaining their bonus against mounted units. They are basically cavalry that excel in killing other cavalry. This is a lot more useful in MP, where cavalry versus cavalry is pretty much a fair game and you need to get riflemen to gain an advantage. Having Cossacks means you already have an advantage against enemy cavalry, forcing your enemies to tech to riflemen to stand a chance on the battlefield or risk being holed up in their cities and becoming sitting targets for your cannons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In SP, however, much of the action would ideally take place at enemy cities to begin with, and in this respect the Cossack is mostly as good as normal cavalry in Warlords. It can get the 2 extra experience points from stables, but so can normal cavalry. The only time you have a real advantage against the AI is when it masses cavalry. In that case, your Cossacks would cut through the AI's army like knife through butter. Unfortunately, you would probably have to capture cities to end the war anyway. That said, Cossacks are pretty good for pillaging if you promote them with Pinch, since they would then be more difficult to counter (neither riflemen nor cavalry would work effectively against them). But, still, as you can see, what was an amazing UU has become a pretty situational one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Spain: Conquistador (Knight)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this UU, the road to El Dorado can be wide and clear. It has the potential to be exploited in a game-breaking way. The reason is this: Conquistadors get 50% bonus vs. melee, which gives it an advantage against the most common counter to knights - pikemen. They also get defensive bonuses, which means they can exploit the terrain to make counterattack difficult. To top all of this off, Conquistadors benefit from 2 first strikes (which normal knights don't get), making them even harder to defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need horse and iron to produce this UU. Playing as Spain, I'd make sure I get those by the time Conquistadors can be built. The Spanish player would also do well to research Guilds early, extending the life and usefulness of the UU. Conquistadors can fill the role of your main city attackers, following your siege weapons to capture city after city. They don't get CR upgrades, but they can perform decently against city defenders even when they haven't accumulated promotions. Their first strikes and immunity to first strikes certainly help, especially against longbows. And, thanks to their bonus against melee, defending pikes don't scare them that much. With defensive bonuses to help, they can also act as stack-protectors during your campaigns. Furthermore, since they have 2 moves, they can attack enemy units and come back to the stack in the same turn. If you're playing on Warlords, they make the perfect companions to Citadel-improved siege weapons. Woe to the enemy cities![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once those shiny cities have been taken, Conquistadors can help defend them until you get suitable defenders (such as longbowmen) there. This works especially well if a city is on a hill. As you can see, the versatility of the Conquistador almost matches that of the Musketeer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, here are a few words of caution. Siege weapons are not to be excluded from your Conquistador campaigns. Unless your target is still fielding archers, bringing siege units for bombardment and some collateral damage should still be part and parcel of your plans. Conquistadors are strong but not invincible. Without the proper support, they would still die to entrenched units, especially pikes and longbows. The other thing is, beware of elephants! These are the ultimate counter to Conquistadors. Under normal circumstances, there is no way a Conquistador can beat an elephant, and the latter is much cheaper to train. Just make sure you target opponents who have no ivory and you should have great time conquering with this UU.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vikings: Berserk (Maceman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] Hate them or love them, Berserks are a popular UU. Although, not as powerful as their Civ3 incarnation, these guys can really be useful. Their 10% bonus vs. cities is certainly nice. However, for many people the problem is finding a good use for their free Amphibious promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Vikings have a higher potential to rule on water maps than any other civ. Ragnar is Financial, which means coastal tiles produce 3 commerce instead of 2, and his UB allows his ships to move further earlier in the game by giving free Navigation promotion. Combined with the Berserk's ability to attack amphibiously with no penalty and its city attack bonus, a Viking player on a water map can fast tech to Civil Service and Machinery and have fun raiding enemy coastal cities with Berserks on fast galleys. One method to do this early is building the Oracle and grabbing Metal Casting as the free tech (which, by the way, gives access to Colossus for a further boost to those coastal tiles). Then build/whip a forge and run an engineer in a city without the Oracle. Research your way to Code of Laws and Civil Service a.s.a.p. (in the pre-patch version you can use a prophet generated by the Oracle to lightbulb CoL/CS by not researching Masonry). In the meantime, build several galleys to prepare for your sea adventures. You'll get a Great Engineer as your 1st or 2nd Great Person from the forge city. Use him to lightbulb Machinery and start building Berserks. You could also put your research slider at 0% for a few turns and upgrade some axes to Berserks (being Financial helps with accumulating money for that). If you catch your opponents without longbows yet, you've done really well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are limitations to your Berserks' ability to raid cities from the sea, though. If a city is defended by longbows, on a hill, has high cultural defense and/or walls, it could be difficult to take and might render an attempt not worth the cost. To attack such a city, you probably need to bring siege units along as galleys/triremes are not able to even bombard the city's defenses. Having to land siege units to bombard/deal collateral damage nullifies the Berserks' amphibious advantage. As such, you would need to look for softer targets to strike at. You don't have to keep the city. Find a weak spot (a lightly defended coastal city), raid, raze and pop back into the galleys before the enemy can counterattack. Landing a spear with the Berserker that has to land on that turn would help the latter survive a counterattack by mounted units (the most likely reaction you'll get from an AI). But becareful not to attack too close to an AI capital. AIs tend to stack more units in their capitals and can easily counterattack with a stronger force from there. Humans in MP will be wary of a sea attack, so watch out for axes/xbows in or within reach of coastal cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even if you're not playing on a water map, Berserks present some interesting options. With them, you have the advantage when laying siege to a city across a river if the enemy doesn't have Engineering. His non-mounted units cannot counter attack from the city without suffering a 20% penalty for attacking across the river. With their free Amphibious promotion, Berserks get no such penalty attacking the city. The only downside is your siege units do suffer from the penalty if you want to cause some collateral damage first. Conversely, this idea works in defense as well. When enemy units are across a river beside one of your cities, you can attack them with your Berserks with no penalty while they would suffer it when they attack. At the very least, Berserks always get their 10% bonus when attacking cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the most valuable thing about the Berserk is the fact that he keeps the Amphibious promotion when upgraded. This allows a Viking player to build Berserks (especially City Raider ones) and upgrade them later on to grenadiers or riflemen with free Amphibious. Frigates are able to bombard city defenses, so you can get yourself an elite amphibious attack force long before marines make their appearance. The free Amphibious also works the opposite way, allowing your older units to benefit from it when upgraded to Berserks. Hence, it makes sense to do so with all of your more experienced axemen or swordsmen. It would almost certainly be worth the money.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Zulus: Impi (Spearman)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Warlords and BTS only.[\BOLD] On the surface, the Impi may not appear to be a stellar UU, since it does not come with extra strength or with obviously strong bonuses. However, the tactical value of this unit is considerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Impi comes with the Mobility promotion (-1 movement cost to enter tiles that would normally cost 2 moves or more) and 2 moves. Thus, they have the ability to rapidly cross territory and catch another nation with a weakly defended city in the early game, when borders are not really expanded and cultural defenses are not high. They can be two tiles from a city and attack it on the same turn that war is declared. Thanks to Aggressive, they also start with Combat I, making them a little stronger. Furthermore, they are eligible for City Raider promotions, which would help crack the defenses of those early cities. Their relatively low cost, meanwhile, helps you amass a number of them as quickly as possible and simply bum rush a close neighbour.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They also make excellent pillagers. With the 100% bonus against mounted that spears get, the only units that can really catch them are not able to kill them effectively. Naturally, they can be put in your stacks or cities to defend and make counterattacks against mounted units. In your own territory, no enemy horse can hope to outrun them, so it's death to the common enemy pillagers![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An interesting gambit you can try is attaching a Great General to an Impi and giving him the Morale promotion, thus creating a 3-move unit with reduced terrain movement cost. If you manage to get it beyond Combat IV, you can add Commando to the collection. It's not going to be a particularly strong unit, but it might have some interesting tactical uses (such as running into a weakly defended part of an enemy empire to killl a worker and then getting out).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, Impis have good synergy with the Zulu UB, the Ikhanda, which is a barrack that also acts as a mini courthouse (-20% maintenance cost for the city). Grab some cities from an unsuspecting opponent as outlined above and rush build Ikhandas in them to help pay for the early extra maintenance. Moreover, being Aggressive, Shaka builds his UB at double production speed, so it's more power to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zulus start conveniently with Hunting, which is required to build their UU, but Impis need copper or iron to be built. If you want to use them as an early attack unit, you must beeline to BW and find copper. If there's no copper around, well, then there's no hope for an Impi rush. The other downside to them is the fact that Mobility becomes useless when you upgrade them, unless you continue doing so all the way till they become mech infantry. No matter what, unroaded terrain would cost at least 1 movement point to enter and, except for mech infantry much later, the Impi's line of units only has 1 move each.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Conquest-Oriented Diplomacy[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]maltz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diplomacy is a very complicated thing. In some multiplayer games (not restricted to CV titles), diplomacy is undisputely the most important factor to victory. I don't have any word to say for Dipoomacy in Multiplayer games, because people are smart, creative, and sometimes annoying spoiled kids.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In single player games; however, the AI opponents can be viewed as dumb human players, who act according to predictable patterns. It is much easier to figure out some guidelines to crack AI's brains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The purpose of this article is to discuss the diplomatic approaches used in a conquest-oriented game. This does not limit to a Conquest Victory, but generally applies to all games that the human player expands effectively and continuously.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If one expands extremely well, then there will be a Conquest Victory, or a Domination Victory. Otherwise one can still achieve Tech (space) Victory. Even if that is not possible, one can still aim for a Diplomatic Victory by adjusting the friend/foe ratio (mentioned later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this board there is an article "Triangle Diplomacy", which is a very good read. This article of mine is a more generalized description of what we can do. In other words, you have to figure out a triangle, a hexagon, an axis, or an alliance yourself. Humans are creative.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I only have 3 general guidelines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep all your opponents equally weak.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep as many foes as friends.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep expanding![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let me explain below.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]1) Keep all your opponents equally weak[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is the core of diplomacy. Do you know why the English divides up the Muslim Middle East in the early 20th century? *cough*[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, you will emerge as the winner if all your opponents are weak. The trouble is other people will do the same to you, by sponsering your life enemy under the table. Do you know how much weapons the US is going to "encourage" Taiwan to buy from them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In CV4, you [BOLD]identify your stronger opponent at the time, and try to bribe the weaker ones to hate it [\BOLD](such as declaring a war). This involves some planning because you need to make friend with the weaker ones in advance. You must know that both bin Laden and Saddam Hussein used to be USA's friends by now. Do you know why they were USA's friends? Hint: they were both fighting against some other super power that no longer exist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you look at the score list, and figure out who needs to be put down, and who will be put down if you don't give them a lift. The high scorers sure needs to go down, and the bottom scorers not necessarily needs a lift (because of your limited power). Sure, it is fun to watch A put down B, but the consequence is A is going to merge B's land and evolves into a monster. You want to be that monster, not somebody else. So your mission here is exactly to help B to defend against A, but not feeding B too much so B eats A alive. When I was little, the TV cartoon hero's mission is always "help the weak to defend against the powerful". They do this for a reason that's not so naive, you see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Things are usually more complicated than just scores, because you will be able to pick sides. Do you want to join the Budda's meditation class, or sing the chant of Hindu Blue? If you join one side, then you make CIvs on the other side hate you. Your powerful friend will become a headache, and your powerful enemy will also threaten your safety directly. This brings up the next guideline...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]2) Keep as many foes as friends.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most effective diplomacy in a war-oriented game is NOT about to make a lot of friends, but to make your friends and foes both busy at fighting each other, while staying on the winning side. Obviously, if you have too many enemies and too little friends, you enemies will overpower you and run you over. So it is easy to pick side at first -- pick the side that will grant you SAFETY![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Less obviously, if you have too many friends, you friends will kill off all the enemies and prosper, or plot some conspiracy against you, and you have no way to stop your friends from surpassing you in score and tech. This isn't the end of the world, though. You can always dump your friends. Saddam is on trial now, isn't he?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is actually [BOLD]a careful balance of friends and foes[\BOLD]. If you see too many enemies, bring one down to restore the balance. If you have too many friends, bring one down to restore the balance. Notice the common phrase here -- bring somebody down...! You are bringing down other Civs, one by one. Eventually you will be the only one left, hence the Conquest Victory comes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The top scorers really needs to go fast. Friend or foe, you must bribe others to bring them down along with you. You are lucky if they are actually your neighbors, but what if they are not? Then you can either raze the cities, or give it to the underdog Civ who won't develop into the next superpower to dethrone yourself. During the "bringing down the biggest threat, then the next, then the next" process, you balance the ratio of friend and foe, to keep them busy with each other. You match them up, A1 hates B1, A2 hates B2, A3 hates B3, or even better A1 also hates B2 and B3, etc. They will drag each other into war, and nobody is really gaining anything through all the war because they are all equally strong, or weak relative to you. Later on, you will have a much easier time to wipe them out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is also very beneficial to bribe your target to attack somebody else, about 10 turns before your grand backstab. 10 turns is about enough to get most of your target's extra troops far away (or killed). Likewise, every time you go to war, make sure you can't get backstabbed. If you can, make all nearby unfriendly Civs busy, so even if your target calls for help, nobody will come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]3) Keep Expanding![\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is really obvious, but easy to froget. I just include it for morale boosting reason. You know the drill. [BOLD]Keep expanding![\BOLD] You already have a good plan of the sequence of attack. On the first second you see the map clear, and the religions laid out, you form some plans of how you are going to win this game, right?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here comes a real game example. Every game is different, but the techniques used are similar. One can never go wrong by being creative, too.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example: http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=120881[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this link above, I have some simplified pictures of the map at different times.

Other Hindu members include Montezuma, Mansa Musa, Alexander, Catherine, and Kublai Khan. Around this time, Monty built a Oracle and founded Judaism, and later converted to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Liz's New Hamshire was taken by Monty very early in the game, before I even met Liz and Monty. The outcome of this skirmish was that Liz was permenantly crippled, and Monty's strong economical/military power was established.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qin declared war on me while I was attacking Napolean, and by wiping Qin out later I made a big mistake. I gave Beijing (yellow BJ on the map) to Saladin, to avoid the death of an exposed, low health, but very highly experienced axeman.

Saladin essentially took over all of Qin's land thanks to my gift of Beijing. Saladin is quickly catching up in tech and he has cottage spawned a huge grassland around Mecca and Medina. My lead is disappearing. Although I am well protected by brother/sister Saladin, Isabella and Bismark, I don't have any bright future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My future is dim not only because my friend Saladin will outgrow me, but also the Hinduism west will unite and become a huge threat. Even Monty has a huge stack waiting.

You got it -- [BOLD] Conquest-oriented Diplomacy![\BOLD] Dang Dang![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My great evil plan is to make a world war. I wish to keep the west busy and hate each other. They will keep fighting, weakening each other, while nobody gains anything, and I gain lands from the east.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately, since I own Buddhism, I can kill 2 birds with 1 baldy, well actually quite a few baldies. These bald missionaries will bring me incomes and friends. With my stream of baldies some Civs in the west will convert to Buddhism, become my friend, take my bribe to attack Hinduism Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I can't convert people without an Open Border, so I have to give them really cheap deals to get the +4 "Our trade relationship has been fair..." so the Hindu Civs' will agree on an Open Border.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point I managed to Open Border with Mansa Musa, Catherine and Kublai. But I have to be careful not to convert everybody - I need as many foes as friends, so they will fight each other, and weaken themselves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a simple pattern of AI's conversion. If an AI doesn't own a particular holy city, it will automatically convert to the religion that has the most popularity in its land. For example, Kubali Khan has 4 cities, 3 of them with Hinduism. He has a good reason to become a Hindu. However, after my missionaries added Budda's shiny statue to ALL 4 of Kublai cities, he converted himself to Buddism. I don't even have to ask and lose a tech. (Well, maybe Saladin or Isabella did)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If there are 2 or more equally popular religions, the AIs can be pursuaded to convert to any side. Another factor is the international atmosphere. Obviously one tries not to become the only pagen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As you can see from my mini-map, Catherine is blocking Kublai's way out, so they are a natural pair of archrival. I want Catherine and Kublai to go that way, even if they like each other now. So, I spread Buddhism to all of Kublai's cities; he converts. However, I spared Cath's Moscow and another city, so Cathy stays a Hindu, which is present in all of Catherine's cities. I still spread Buddhism to other Catherine's cities so I get some income from them from my Shrine.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Catherine and Kublai used to be close friends, but after Kublai's flip, I easily bribed Cathy (the best backstabber according to Personality Matrix) to go after Kublai.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another example I have is Mansa Musa and Alexander. Alexander helped Monty to attack Mansa before (Alex briefly converted to Judaism, but converted back to Hinduism later), so MM and Alex already dislike each other. Now since my baldies cannot enter Alexander's land due to a lack of Open Border, I convert Mansa Musa to Buddhism. They are now even more likely to fight again in the future![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to make sure Mansa Musa the crazy tech racer is not doing the best he could, I bribed MM to go after Monty. He took one of Monty's cities, and Monty took one of his. Excellent![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I also bribed Bismark to go after Monty, just to make them hate each other, and keep Monty's attention away from me. (I am a paranoid, thinking Monty's huge stack was intended to me). Monty's stack of death sacked Bismark's border city, but didn't do so well on Hamburg's tough defense. Monty didn't use any catapult and simply threw them to the stone wall. Now Monty hates Bismark more than me, and I will be able to border Monty safer after I take Saladin's northern territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now the (miserable) future of the West is roughly decided; I can concentrate on the present east - my rival Saladin. The war isn't the point of this article, so I will just tell you in brief. I bribing Saladin to go after Elizebeth, and mass produced all kinds of troops to backstab Saladin. If I didn't bribe Saladin's large maceman stack away, I don't think I had a chance, though.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]50 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally I took over Saladin's lands on the east. Interestingly, Saladin never pulled back his maceman, but to leave all of them in the west, defending London and other English cities, which he captured from Elizebeth (stupid AI. Any human player would give up those cities and rush back to defend homeland.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My troop chased Saladin across the Pangaea, and finished him in a small town on the west coast. That town used to be a prosperous city of Mansa Musa, but Monty sacked it, and culturally it flipped to the English, only to be taken by Saladin a few turns later. Now this town is given away to Alexander by me, along with other former English cities. Alex has been in the bottom of the list for long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apparantly it is a weird decision of me to give 3 cities to Alex. York is the holy city of Hinduism. By giving it to Hindu Alex, I am pretty much gauranteed a Hindu Alex in the future, and sure he will not like me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So why do I bother to make a potential enemy strong? Well, I really want to establish some enemies for Mansa Musa, the notorious tech racer. With a well-grwon Alex in the future, Mansa Musa will be surrounded by 3 hostiles, Monty, Alex and Catherine. (I bribed MM to attack Cathy later. You can see on the next map St. Peterburg was taken by MM's musketeer, thanks to my free gunpowder.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to summrize the relationships in the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monty (Judaism) - Catherine (Hinduism) - Alexander (Hinduism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]vs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (Buddhism) - Bismark (Buddism) - Kublai Khan (Buddism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Past wars:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MM --(attacked)--&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Bismark --&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; MM[NEWLINE]Catherine --&gt; Kublai[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; Bismark[NEWLINE]MM --&gt; Catherine[NEWLINE]Monty --&gt; MM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]380 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the west further "blanaced", I had the free time to take out Isabella. Actually the war with Saladin cost me a few hundred years in tech development. I rushed to Chemistry by Liberalism. Before Liberalism I rushed Economics to get the free Great Merchant. Guess how much I got from MM's capital? 6900G! I upgraded all of my assaulting melee units to Grenadiers, and still had more than 2000G left. Isabella, who has never seen war, became a victim of Grenadier + knight + musketeer + catapult sea rush. She went down on the 8th turn. If I had not bribed the western world to war on each other, they would definitely beat me on Economics and Liberalism at this point. (I beat MM of Economics by 2 turns.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is now clear that I am going to win. I will then take down the other Civs one by one, a friend, an enemy, a friend, an enemy, until there is nobody left.

		<French>[H1]Conquest-Oriented Diplomacy[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]maltz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diplomacy is a very complicated thing. In some multiplayer games (not restricted to CV titles), diplomacy is undisputely the most important factor to victory. I don't have any word to say for Dipoomacy in Multiplayer games, because people are smart, creative, and sometimes annoying spoiled kids.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In single player games; however, the AI opponents can be viewed as dumb human players, who act according to predictable patterns. It is much easier to figure out some guidelines to crack AI's brains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The purpose of this article is to discuss the diplomatic approaches used in a conquest-oriented game. This does not limit to a Conquest Victory, but generally applies to all games that the human player expands effectively and continuously.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If one expands extremely well, then there will be a Conquest Victory, or a Domination Victory. Otherwise one can still achieve Tech (space) Victory. Even if that is not possible, one can still aim for a Diplomatic Victory by adjusting the friend/foe ratio (mentioned later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this board there is an article "Triangle Diplomacy", which is a very good read. This article of mine is a more generalized description of what we can do. In other words, you have to figure out a triangle, a hexagon, an axis, or an alliance yourself. Humans are creative.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I only have 3 general guidelines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep all your opponents equally weak.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep as many foes as friends.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep expanding![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let me explain below.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]1) Keep all your opponents equally weak[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is the core of diplomacy. Do you know why the English divides up the Muslim Middle East in the early 20th century? *cough*[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, you will emerge as the winner if all your opponents are weak. The trouble is other people will do the same to you, by sponsering your life enemy under the table. Do you know how much weapons the US is going to "encourage" Taiwan to buy from them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In CV4, you [BOLD]identify your stronger opponent at the time, and try to bribe the weaker ones to hate it [\BOLD](such as declaring a war). This involves some planning because you need to make friend with the weaker ones in advance. You must know that both bin Laden and Saddam Hussein used to be USA's friends by now. Do you know why they were USA's friends? Hint: they were both fighting against some other super power that no longer exist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you look at the score list, and figure out who needs to be put down, and who will be put down if you don't give them a lift. The high scorers sure needs to go down, and the bottom scorers not necessarily needs a lift (because of your limited power). Sure, it is fun to watch A put down B, but the consequence is A is going to merge B's land and evolves into a monster. You want to be that monster, not somebody else. So your mission here is exactly to help B to defend against A, but not feeding B too much so B eats A alive. When I was little, the TV cartoon hero's mission is always "help the weak to defend against the powerful". They do this for a reason that's not so naive, you see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Things are usually more complicated than just scores, because you will be able to pick sides. Do you want to join the Budda's meditation class, or sing the chant of Hindu Blue? If you join one side, then you make CIvs on the other side hate you. Your powerful friend will become a headache, and your powerful enemy will also threaten your safety directly.

This isn't the end of the world, though. You can always dump your friends. Saddam is on trial now, isn't he?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is actually [BOLD]a careful balance of friends and foes[\BOLD].

Otherwise one can still achieve Tech (space) Victory. Even if that is not possible, one can still aim for a Diplomatic Victory by adjusting the friend/foe ratio (mentioned later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this board there is an article "Triangle Diplomacy", which is a very good read. This article of mine is a more generalized description of what we can do. In other words, you have to figure out a triangle, a hexagon, an axis, or an alliance yourself. Humans are creative.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I only have 3 general guidelines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep all your opponents equally weak.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep as many foes as friends.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep expanding![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let me explain below.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]1) Keep all your opponents equally weak[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is the core of diplomacy. Do you know why the English divides up the Muslim Middle East in the early 20th century? *cough*[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, you will emerge as the winner if all your opponents are weak. The trouble is other people will do the same to you, by sponsering your life enemy under the table. Do you know how much weapons the US is going to "encourage" Taiwan to buy from them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In CV4, you [BOLD]identify your stronger opponent at the time, and try to bribe the weaker ones to hate it [\BOLD](such as declaring a war). This involves some planning because you need to make friend with the weaker ones in advance. You must know that both bin Laden and Saddam Hussein used to be USA's friends by now. Do you know why they were USA's friends? Hint: they were both fighting against some other super power that no longer exist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you look at the score list, and figure out who needs to be put down, and who will be put down if you don't give them a lift. The high scorers sure needs to go down, and the bottom scorers not necessarily needs a lift (because of your limited power). Sure, it is fun to watch A put down B, but the consequence is A is going to merge B's land and evolves into a monster. You want to be that monster, not somebody else. So your mission here is exactly to help B to defend against A, but not feeding B too much so B eats A alive. When I was little, the TV cartoon hero's mission is always "help the weak to defend against the powerful". They do this for a reason that's not so naive, you see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Things are usually more complicated than just scores, because you will be able to pick sides. Do you want to join the Budda's meditation class, or sing the chant of Hindu Blue? If you join one side, then you make CIvs on the other side hate you. Your powerful friend will become a headache, and your powerful enemy will also threaten your safety directly. This brings up the next guideline...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]2) Keep as many foes as friends.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most effective diplomacy in a war-oriented game is NOT about to make a lot of friends, but to make your friends and foes both busy at fighting each other, while staying on the winning side. Obviously, if you have too many enemies and too little friends, you enemies will overpower you and run you over. So it is easy to pick side at first -- pick the side that will grant you SAFETY![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Less obviously, if you have too many friends, you friends will kill off all the enemies and prosper, or plot some conspiracy against you, and you have no way to stop your friends from surpassing you in score and tech. This isn't the end of the world, though. You can always dump your friends. Saddam is on trial now, isn't he?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is actually [BOLD]a careful balance of friends and foes[\BOLD]. If you see too many enemies, bring one down to restore the balance. If you have too many friends, bring one down to restore the balance. Notice the common phrase here -- bring somebody down...! You are bringing down other Civs, one by one. Eventually you will be the only one left, hence the Conquest Victory comes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The top scorers really needs to go fast. Friend or foe, you must bribe others to bring them down along with you. You are lucky if they are actually your neighbors, but what if they are not? Then you can either raze the cities, or give it to the underdog Civ who won't develop into the next superpower to dethrone yourself. During the "bringing down the biggest threat, then the next, then the next" process, you balance the ratio of friend and foe, to keep them busy with each other. You match them up, A1 hates B1, A2 hates B2, A3 hates B3, or even better A1 also hates B2 and B3, etc. They will drag each other into war, and nobody is really gaining anything through all the war because they are all equally strong, or weak relative to you. Later on, you will have a much easier time to wipe them out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is also very beneficial to bribe your target to attack somebody else, about 10 turns before your grand backstab. 10 turns is about enough to get most of your target's extra troops far away (or killed). Likewise, every time you go to war, make sure you can't get backstabbed. If you can, make all nearby unfriendly Civs busy, so even if your target calls for help, nobody will come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]3) Keep Expanding![\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is really obvious, but easy to froget. I just include it for morale boosting reason. You know the drill. [BOLD]Keep expanding![\BOLD] You already have a good plan of the sequence of attack. On the first second you see the map clear, and the religions laid out, you form some plans of how you are going to win this game, right?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here comes a real game example. Every game is different, but the techniques used are similar. One can never go wrong by being creative, too.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example: http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=120881[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this link above, I have some simplified pictures of the map at different times. They are not totally to scale, just for reference. You may want to un-shrink the map on your web browser to see the fonts clearly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this game I am the Magenta Civ (Mao) on the very right end of the Standard Pangaea. Don't worry about the city names - the leaders are matched to their color. To my left are:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ghandi (purple)[NEWLINE]Roosevelt (blue)[NEWLINE]Saladin (dark green)[NEWLINE]Isabella (pink)[NEWLINE]Napolean (dark blue)[NEWLINE]Bismark (dark grey)[NEWLINE]Qin Shi Huang (yellow)[NEWLINE]Montezuma (light green)[NEWLINE]Elizebeth (light grey)[NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (greenish brown)[NEWLINE]Kublai Khan (brown)[NEWLINE]Catherine (orange)[NEWLINE]Alexander (blue-green)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1800 BC[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My workers are hard choppers, and my axemen are swarming around like locusts. The international atomsphere is taking its shape. Ghandi founded Buddism earlier, and Bombay the Holy City is under my control. Lucky for me, Buddism spread to all of my religiously-fanatic neighbors, so they were all very happy with me (except Qin who declared war on me very soon.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apart from the Buddhism east, there is Hinduism west, slightly larger and centered on York (Elizebeth). Other Hindu members include Montezuma, Mansa Musa, Alexander, Catherine, and Kublai Khan. Around this time, Monty built a Oracle and founded Judaism, and later converted to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Liz's New Hamshire was taken by Monty very early in the game, before I even met Liz and Monty. The outcome of this skirmish was that Liz was permenantly crippled, and Monty's strong economical/military power was established.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qin declared war on me while I was attacking Napolean, and by wiping Qin out later I made a big mistake. I gave Beijing (yellow BJ on the map) to Saladin, to avoid the death of an exposed, low health, but very highly experienced axeman. Saladin was the only Civ I've met at the time who was willing to take the gift, so I had no other choice. I should have just razed Beijing, and sacrifice that poor axeman. (more on the consequence later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]700BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With 9 cities to boot I was leading in score, followed closely by Saladin, then Monty. Saladin essentially took over all of Qin's land thanks to my gift of Beijing. Saladin is quickly catching up in tech and he has cottage spawned a huge grassland around Mecca and Medina. My lead is disappearing. Although I am well protected by brother/sister Saladin, Isabella and Bismark, I don't have any bright future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My future is dim not only because my friend Saladin will outgrow me, but also the Hinduism west will unite and become a huge threat. Even Monty has a huge stack waiting. (see here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=120672&amp;d=1143322043)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What can save me besides the map editor? You got it -- [BOLD] Conquest-oriented Diplomacy![\BOLD] Dang Dang![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My great evil plan is to make a world war. I wish to keep the west busy and hate each other. They will keep fighting, weakening each other, while nobody gains anything, and I gain lands from the east.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately, since I own Buddhism, I can kill 2 birds with 1 baldy, well actually quite a few baldies. These bald missionaries will bring me incomes and friends. With my stream of baldies some Civs in the west will convert to Buddhism, become my friend, take my bribe to attack Hinduism Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I can't convert people without an Open Border, so I have to give them really cheap deals to get the +4 "Our trade relationship has been fair..." so the Hindu Civs' will agree on an Open Border.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point I managed to Open Border with Mansa Musa, Catherine and Kublai. But I have to be careful not to convert everybody - I need as many foes as friends, so they will fight each other, and weaken themselves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a simple pattern of AI's conversion. If an AI doesn't own a particular holy city, it will automatically convert to the religion that has the most popularity in its land. For example, Kubali Khan has 4 cities, 3 of them with Hinduism. He has a good reason to become a Hindu. However, after my missionaries added Budda's shiny statue to ALL 4 of Kublai cities, he converted himself to Buddism. I don't even have to ask and lose a tech. (Well, maybe Saladin or Isabella did)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If there are 2 or more equally popular religions, the AIs can be pursuaded to convert to any side. Another factor is the international atmosphere. Obviously one tries not to become the only pagen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As you can see from my mini-map, Catherine is blocking Kublai's way out, so they are a natural pair of archrival. I want Catherine and Kublai to go that way, even if they like each other now. So, I spread Buddhism to all of Kublai's cities; he converts. However, I spared Cath's Moscow and another city, so Cathy stays a Hindu, which is present in all of Catherine's cities. I still spread Buddhism to other Catherine's cities so I get some income from them from my Shrine.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Catherine and Kublai used to be close friends, but after Kublai's flip, I easily bribed Cathy (the best backstabber according to Personality Matrix) to go after Kublai.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another example I have is Mansa Musa and Alexander. Alexander helped Monty to attack Mansa before (Alex briefly converted to Judaism, but converted back to Hinduism later), so MM and Alex already dislike each other. Now since my baldies cannot enter Alexander's land due to a lack of Open Border, I convert Mansa Musa to Buddhism. They are now even more likely to fight again in the future![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to make sure Mansa Musa the crazy tech racer is not doing the best he could, I bribed MM to go after Monty. He took one of Monty's cities, and Monty took one of his. Excellent![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I also bribed Bismark to go after Monty, just to make them hate each other, and keep Monty's attention away from me. (I am a paranoid, thinking Monty's huge stack was intended to me). Monty's stack of death sacked Bismark's border city, but didn't do so well on Hamburg's tough defense. Monty didn't use any catapult and simply threw them to the stone wall. Now Monty hates Bismark more than me, and I will be able to border Monty safer after I take Saladin's northern territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now the (miserable) future of the West is roughly decided; I can concentrate on the present east - my rival Saladin. The war isn't the point of this article, so I will just tell you in brief. I bribing Saladin to go after Elizebeth, and mass produced all kinds of troops to backstab Saladin. If I didn't bribe Saladin's large maceman stack away, I don't think I had a chance, though.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]50 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally I took over Saladin's lands on the east. Interestingly, Saladin never pulled back his maceman, but to leave all of them in the west, defending London and other English cities, which he captured from Elizebeth (stupid AI. Any human player would give up those cities and rush back to defend homeland.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My troop chased Saladin across the Pangaea, and finished him in a small town on the west coast. That town used to be a prosperous city of Mansa Musa, but Monty sacked it, and culturally it flipped to the English, only to be taken by Saladin a few turns later. Now this town is given away to Alexander by me, along with other former English cities. Alex has been in the bottom of the list for long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apparantly it is a weird decision of me to give 3 cities to Alex. York is the holy city of Hinduism. By giving it to Hindu Alex, I am pretty much gauranteed a Hindu Alex in the future, and sure he will not like me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So why do I bother to make a potential enemy strong? Well, I really want to establish some enemies for Mansa Musa, the notorious tech racer. With a well-grwon Alex in the future, Mansa Musa will be surrounded by 3 hostiles, Monty, Alex and Catherine. (I bribed MM to attack Cathy later. You can see on the next map St. Peterburg was taken by MM's musketeer, thanks to my free gunpowder.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to summrize the relationships in the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monty (Judaism) - Catherine (Hinduism) - Alexander (Hinduism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]vs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (Buddhism) - Bismark (Buddism) - Kublai Khan (Buddism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Past wars:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MM --(attacked)--&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Bismark --&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; MM[NEWLINE]Catherine --&gt; Kublai[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; Bismark[NEWLINE]MM --&gt; Catherine[NEWLINE]Monty --&gt; MM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]380 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the west further "blanaced", I had the free time to take out Isabella. Actually the war with Saladin cost me a few hundred years in tech development. I rushed to Chemistry by Liberalism. Before Liberalism I rushed Economics to get the free Great Merchant. Guess how much I got from MM's capital? 6900G! I upgraded all of my assaulting melee units to Grenadiers, and still had more than 2000G left. Isabella, who has never seen war, became a victim of Grenadier + knight + musketeer + catapult sea rush. She went down on the 8th turn. If I had not bribed the western world to war on each other, they would definitely beat me on Economics and Liberalism at this point. (I beat MM of Economics by 2 turns.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is now clear that I am going to win. I will then take down the other Civs one by one, a friend, an enemy, a friend, an enemy, until there is nobody left. I think Bismark -&gt; Monty -&gt; MM -&gt; Alex -&gt; Cathy -&gt; Kublai is a good route.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To the power of Diplomacy!</German>

You can see on the next map St. Peterburg was taken by MM's musketeer, thanks to my free gunpowder.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to summrize the relationships in the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monty (Judaism) - Catherine (Hinduism) - Alexander (Hinduism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]vs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (Buddhism) - Bismark (Buddism) - Kublai Khan (Buddism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Past wars:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MM --(attacked)--&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Bismark --&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; MM[NEWLINE]Catherine --&gt; Kublai[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; Bismark[NEWLINE]MM --&gt; Catherine[NEWLINE]Monty --&gt; MM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]380 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the west further "blanaced", I had the free time to take out Isabella. Actually the war with Saladin cost me a few hundred years in tech development. I rushed to Chemistry by Liberalism. Before Liberalism I rushed Economics to get the free Great Merchant. Guess how much I got from MM's capital? 6900G! I upgraded all of my assaulting melee units to Grenadiers, and still had more than 2000G left. Isabella, who has never seen war, became a victim of Grenadier + knight + musketeer + catapult sea rush. She went down on the 8th turn. If I had not bribed the western world to war on each other, they would definitely beat me on Economics and Liberalism at this point. (I beat MM of Economics by 2 turns.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is now clear that I am going to win. I will then take down the other Civs one by one, a friend, an enemy, a friend, an enemy, until there is nobody left. I think Bismark -&gt; Monty -&gt; MM -&gt; Alex -&gt; Cathy -&gt; Kublai is a good route.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To the power of Diplomacy!</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Conquest-Oriented Diplomacy[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]maltz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diplomacy is a very complicated thing. In some multiplayer games (not restricted to CV titles), diplomacy is undisputely the most important factor to victory. I don't have any word to say for Dipoomacy in Multiplayer games, because people are smart, creative, and sometimes annoying spoiled kids.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In single player games; however, the AI opponents can be viewed as dumb human players, who act according to predictable patterns. It is much easier to figure out some guidelines to crack AI's brains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The purpose of this article is to discuss the diplomatic approaches used in a conquest-oriented game. This does not limit to a Conquest Victory, but generally applies to all games that the human player expands effectively and continuously.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If one expands extremely well, then there will be a Conquest Victory, or a Domination Victory. Otherwise one can still achieve Tech (space) Victory. Even if that is not possible, one can still aim for a Diplomatic Victory by adjusting the friend/foe ratio (mentioned later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this board there is an article "Triangle Diplomacy", which is a very good read. This article of mine is a more generalized description of what we can do. In other words, you have to figure out a triangle, a hexagon, an axis, or an alliance yourself. Humans are creative.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I only have 3 general guidelines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep all your opponents equally weak.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep as many foes as friends.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Keep expanding![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let me explain below.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]1) Keep all your opponents equally weak[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is the core of diplomacy. Do you know why the English divides up the Muslim Middle East in the early 20th century? *cough*[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Obviously, you will emerge as the winner if all your opponents are weak. The trouble is other people will do the same to you, by sponsering your life enemy under the table. Do you know how much weapons the US is going to "encourage" Taiwan to buy from them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In CV4, you [BOLD]identify your stronger opponent at the time, and try to bribe the weaker ones to hate it [\BOLD](such as declaring a war). This involves some planning because you need to make friend with the weaker ones in advance. You must know that both bin Laden and Saddam Hussein used to be USA's friends by now. Do you know why they were USA's friends? Hint: they were both fighting against some other super power that no longer exist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you look at the score list, and figure out who needs to be put down, and who will be put down if you don't give them a lift. The high scorers sure needs to go down, and the bottom scorers not necessarily needs a lift (because of your limited power). Sure, it is fun to watch A put down B, but the consequence is A is going to merge B's land and evolves into a monster. You want to be that monster, not somebody else. So your mission here is exactly to help B to defend against A, but not feeding B too much so B eats A alive. When I was little, the TV cartoon hero's mission is always "help the weak to defend against the powerful". They do this for a reason that's not so naive, you see.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Things are usually more complicated than just scores, because you will be able to pick sides. Do you want to join the Budda's meditation class, or sing the chant of Hindu Blue? If you join one side, then you make CIvs on the other side hate you. Your powerful friend will become a headache, and your powerful enemy will also threaten your safety directly. This brings up the next guideline...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]2) Keep as many foes as friends.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most effective diplomacy in a war-oriented game is NOT about to make a lot of friends, but to make your friends and foes both busy at fighting each other, while staying on the winning side. Obviously, if you have too many enemies and too little friends, you enemies will overpower you and run you over. So it is easy to pick side at first -- pick the side that will grant you SAFETY![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Less obviously, if you have too many friends, you friends will kill off all the enemies and prosper, or plot some conspiracy against you, and you have no way to stop your friends from surpassing you in score and tech. This isn't the end of the world, though. You can always dump your friends. Saddam is on trial now, isn't he?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is actually [BOLD]a careful balance of friends and foes[\BOLD]. If you see too many enemies, bring one down to restore the balance. If you have too many friends, bring one down to restore the balance. Notice the common phrase here -- bring somebody down...! You are bringing down other Civs, one by one. Eventually you will be the only one left, hence the Conquest Victory comes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The top scorers really needs to go fast. Friend or foe, you must bribe others to bring them down along with you. You are lucky if they are actually your neighbors, but what if they are not? Then you can either raze the cities, or give it to the underdog Civ who won't develop into the next superpower to dethrone yourself. During the "bringing down the biggest threat, then the next, then the next" process, you balance the ratio of friend and foe, to keep them busy with each other. You match them up, A1 hates B1, A2 hates B2, A3 hates B3, or even better A1 also hates B2 and B3, etc. They will drag each other into war, and nobody is really gaining anything through all the war because they are all equally strong, or weak relative to you. Later on, you will have a much easier time to wipe them out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is also very beneficial to bribe your target to attack somebody else, about 10 turns before your grand backstab. 10 turns is about enough to get most of your target's extra troops far away (or killed). Likewise, every time you go to war, make sure you can't get backstabbed. If you can, make all nearby unfriendly Civs busy, so even if your target calls for help, nobody will come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]3) Keep Expanding![\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is really obvious, but easy to froget. I just include it for morale boosting reason. You know the drill. [BOLD]Keep expanding![\BOLD] You already have a good plan of the sequence of attack. On the first second you see the map clear, and the religions laid out, you form some plans of how you are going to win this game, right?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here comes a real game example. Every game is different, but the techniques used are similar. One can never go wrong by being creative, too.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Example: http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=120881[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this link above, I have some simplified pictures of the map at different times. They are not totally to scale, just for reference. You may want to un-shrink the map on your web browser to see the fonts clearly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In this game I am the Magenta Civ (Mao) on the very right end of the Standard Pangaea. Don't worry about the city names - the leaders are matched to their color. To my left are:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ghandi (purple)[NEWLINE]Roosevelt (blue)[NEWLINE]Saladin (dark green)[NEWLINE]Isabella (pink)[NEWLINE]Napolean (dark blue)[NEWLINE]Bismark (dark grey)[NEWLINE]Qin Shi Huang (yellow)[NEWLINE]Montezuma (light green)[NEWLINE]Elizebeth (light grey)[NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (greenish brown)[NEWLINE]Kublai Khan (brown)[NEWLINE]Catherine (orange)[NEWLINE]Alexander (blue-green)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1800 BC[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My workers are hard choppers, and my axemen are swarming around like locusts. The international atomsphere is taking its shape. Ghandi founded Buddism earlier, and Bombay the Holy City is under my control. Lucky for me, Buddism spread to all of my religiously-fanatic neighbors, so they were all very happy with me (except Qin who declared war on me very soon.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apart from the Buddhism east, there is Hinduism west, slightly larger and centered on York (Elizebeth). Other Hindu members include Montezuma, Mansa Musa, Alexander, Catherine, and Kublai Khan. Around this time, Monty built a Oracle and founded Judaism, and later converted to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Liz's New Hamshire was taken by Monty very early in the game, before I even met Liz and Monty. The outcome of this skirmish was that Liz was permenantly crippled, and Monty's strong economical/military power was established.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qin declared war on me while I was attacking Napolean, and by wiping Qin out later I made a big mistake. I gave Beijing (yellow BJ on the map) to Saladin, to avoid the death of an exposed, low health, but very highly experienced axeman. Saladin was the only Civ I've met at the time who was willing to take the gift, so I had no other choice. I should have just razed Beijing, and sacrifice that poor axeman. (more on the consequence later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]700BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With 9 cities to boot I was leading in score, followed closely by Saladin, then Monty. Saladin essentially took over all of Qin's land thanks to my gift of Beijing. Saladin is quickly catching up in tech and he has cottage spawned a huge grassland around Mecca and Medina. My lead is disappearing. Although I am well protected by brother/sister Saladin, Isabella and Bismark, I don't have any bright future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My future is dim not only because my friend Saladin will outgrow me, but also the Hinduism west will unite and become a huge threat. Even Monty has a huge stack waiting. (see here: http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=120672&amp;d=1143322043)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What can save me besides the map editor? You got it -- [BOLD] Conquest-oriented Diplomacy![\BOLD] Dang Dang![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My great evil plan is to make a world war. I wish to keep the west busy and hate each other. They will keep fighting, weakening each other, while nobody gains anything, and I gain lands from the east.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fortunately, since I own Buddhism, I can kill 2 birds with 1 baldy, well actually quite a few baldies. These bald missionaries will bring me incomes and friends. With my stream of baldies some Civs in the west will convert to Buddhism, become my friend, take my bribe to attack Hinduism Civs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I can't convert people without an Open Border, so I have to give them really cheap deals to get the +4 "Our trade relationship has been fair..." so the Hindu Civs' will agree on an Open Border.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point I managed to Open Border with Mansa Musa, Catherine and Kublai. But I have to be careful not to convert everybody - I need as many foes as friends, so they will fight each other, and weaken themselves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a simple pattern of AI's conversion. If an AI doesn't own a particular holy city, it will automatically convert to the religion that has the most popularity in its land. For example, Kubali Khan has 4 cities, 3 of them with Hinduism. He has a good reason to become a Hindu. However, after my missionaries added Budda's shiny statue to ALL 4 of Kublai cities, he converted himself to Buddism. I don't even have to ask and lose a tech. (Well, maybe Saladin or Isabella did)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If there are 2 or more equally popular religions, the AIs can be pursuaded to convert to any side. Another factor is the international atmosphere. Obviously one tries not to become the only pagen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As you can see from my mini-map, Catherine is blocking Kublai's way out, so they are a natural pair of archrival. I want Catherine and Kublai to go that way, even if they like each other now. So, I spread Buddhism to all of Kublai's cities; he converts. However, I spared Cath's Moscow and another city, so Cathy stays a Hindu, which is present in all of Catherine's cities. I still spread Buddhism to other Catherine's cities so I get some income from them from my Shrine.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Catherine and Kublai used to be close friends, but after Kublai's flip, I easily bribed Cathy (the best backstabber according to Personality Matrix) to go after Kublai.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another example I have is Mansa Musa and Alexander. Alexander helped Monty to attack Mansa before (Alex briefly converted to Judaism, but converted back to Hinduism later), so MM and Alex already dislike each other. Now since my baldies cannot enter Alexander's land due to a lack of Open Border, I convert Mansa Musa to Buddhism. They are now even more likely to fight again in the future![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to make sure Mansa Musa the crazy tech racer is not doing the best he could, I bribed MM to go after Monty. He took one of Monty's cities, and Monty took one of his. Excellent![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I also bribed Bismark to go after Monty, just to make them hate each other, and keep Monty's attention away from me. (I am a paranoid, thinking Monty's huge stack was intended to me). Monty's stack of death sacked Bismark's border city, but didn't do so well on Hamburg's tough defense. Monty didn't use any catapult and simply threw them to the stone wall. Now Monty hates Bismark more than me, and I will be able to border Monty safer after I take Saladin's northern territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now the (miserable) future of the West is roughly decided; I can concentrate on the present east - my rival Saladin. The war isn't the point of this article, so I will just tell you in brief. I bribing Saladin to go after Elizebeth, and mass produced all kinds of troops to backstab Saladin. If I didn't bribe Saladin's large maceman stack away, I don't think I had a chance, though.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]50 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally I took over Saladin's lands on the east. Interestingly, Saladin never pulled back his maceman, but to leave all of them in the west, defending London and other English cities, which he captured from Elizebeth (stupid AI. Any human player would give up those cities and rush back to defend homeland.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]My troop chased Saladin across the Pangaea, and finished him in a small town on the west coast. That town used to be a prosperous city of Mansa Musa, but Monty sacked it, and culturally it flipped to the English, only to be taken by Saladin a few turns later. Now this town is given away to Alexander by me, along with other former English cities. Alex has been in the bottom of the list for long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apparantly it is a weird decision of me to give 3 cities to Alex. York is the holy city of Hinduism. By giving it to Hindu Alex, I am pretty much gauranteed a Hindu Alex in the future, and sure he will not like me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So why do I bother to make a potential enemy strong? Well, I really want to establish some enemies for Mansa Musa, the notorious tech racer. With a well-grwon Alex in the future, Mansa Musa will be surrounded by 3 hostiles, Monty, Alex and Catherine. (I bribed MM to attack Cathy later. You can see on the next map St. Peterburg was taken by MM's musketeer, thanks to my free gunpowder.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just to summrize the relationships in the west.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monty (Judaism) - Catherine (Hinduism) - Alexander (Hinduism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]vs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mansa Musa (Buddhism) - Bismark (Buddism) - Kublai Khan (Buddism)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Past wars:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MM --(attacked)--&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Bismark --&gt; Monty[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; MM[NEWLINE]Catherine --&gt; Kublai[NEWLINE]Alexander --&gt; Bismark[NEWLINE]MM --&gt; Catherine[NEWLINE]Monty --&gt; MM[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]380 AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the west further "blanaced", I had the free time to take out Isabella. Actually the war with Saladin cost me a few hundred years in tech development. I rushed to Chemistry by Liberalism. Before Liberalism I rushed Economics to get the free Great Merchant. Guess how much I got from MM's capital? 6900G! I upgraded all of my assaulting melee units to Grenadiers, and still had more than 2000G left. Isabella, who has never seen war, became a victim of Grenadier + knight + musketeer + catapult sea rush. She went down on the 8th turn. If I had not bribed the western world to war on each other, they would definitely beat me on Economics and Liberalism at this point. (I beat MM of Economics by 2 turns.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is now clear that I am going to win. I will then take down the other Civs one by one, a friend, an enemy, a friend, an enemy, until there is nobody left.

Although it was written for Vanilla Civ 4, it includes information relevant to the Warlords expansion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you accessed this article through the War Academy, it may be worth checking the associated thread for updates: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=157954[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I welcome any feedback. Please post to direct my attention to anything which is not accurate. Don't hesitate to add any tips you think would benefit the article or make it more comprehensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have included a list of useful tips/observations at the conclusion of the article for your convenience.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term [BOLD]friendly[\BOLD] will be used in this article to describe a civ with whom you are at peace. [BOLD]Allied[\BOLD] civs include teammates and civs with a permanent alliance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit which is damaged (less than 100HP) and [BOLD]eligible[\BOLD] (see below) for healing will be healed at the beginning of the next turn, after all other AIs/players/barbarians have had their turns. An eligible unit will stop healing only when it reaches 100HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit is [BOLD]eligible[\BOLD] for healing if it "forfeits" its turn. More explicitly, there are actions which disqualify a unit from being eligible for healing, and actions which have no effect on a unit's eligibility. Details below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Eligibility for Healing[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit that performs ANY of the following actions will NOT be eligible for healing:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Movement (this does not include the indirect movement of cargo in transports)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Attack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Pillage[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bombard[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Load or unload (including from ship to ship)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Airlift[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bombing/Air Strike (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Reconnaissance (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Re-basing (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Upgrade[NEWLINE][BOLD]EXCEPTION: The March promotion[\BOLD][NEWLINE]A unit with the March promotion is ALWAYS eligible for healing. Any of the above actions which ordinarily disqualify a unit from being allowed to heal instead have no effect. For example, a March-promoted Cavalry can move 1 tile, attack, and then still be eligible for healing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following actions will [BOLD]not[\BOLD] affect a unit's eligibility for healing:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Fortify[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sleep[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sentry[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Defending from an attack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sitting in a cargo ship while it moves[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Accepting a promotion[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Intercept Mission (air units)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In most documentation on unit healing, a unit will be said to heal some "percentage" in a turn. eg. the manual will tell you Medic I heals units on the same tile by 10%. The percent healed is the same as the number of HP healed. eg. A medic will add 10HP to units it heals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit's heal rate is determined by adding its [BOLD]Base Heal Rate[\BOLD] to, if applicable, any [BOLD]medic[\BOLD] healing, [BOLD]hospital[\BOLD] healing and healing from [BOLD]Combat[\BOLD] promotions. Details below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Base Heal Rate[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eligible units will heal:[NEWLINE]5HP per turn in enemy territory,[NEWLINE]10HP per turn in neutral territory (but not a city). Note: Neutral territory includes unclaimed territory and the territory of friendly civs, but not allied civs.[NEWLINE]15HP per turn in home/allied territory (but not a city) or in any city which is in resistance[NEWLINE]20HP per turn in a city which is not in resistance[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Medics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit with the Medic I promotion will heal all eligible units on the same tile by 10HP.[NEWLINE]A medic can move and then heal units on the tile it ends its turn on.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic I heals itself if eligible.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic II will heal all eligible units in any adjacent tiles by 10HP. Minor note: a unit with Medic II but not Medic I will NOT heal units on the same tile.[NEWLINE][BOLD]IMPORTANT NOTE: Units with Medic II cannot heal units across a land/sea boundary. Ships in port are considered to be on the land side of the land/sea boundary.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No more than one Medic unit can operate on a unit eligible for healing each turn.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic I and II does not heal units on the same tile any quicker than if it had only Medic I.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any ships (including transport ships) with Medic I will heal eligible units in their cargo or on the same tile.[NEWLINE]A medic unit can heal land, air and naval units.[NEWLINE]Medics can heal the units of an allied civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Minor note: The Red Cross wonder only gives the Medic I promotion to units which are ordinarily allowed to accept that promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords: In the Warlords expansion, the presence of a great general allows the Medic III Promotion for Medic II promoted units. The Medic III Promotion gives an additional 15HP of healing to units on the same tile and adjacent tiles, totalling 25HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Hospitals[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A hospital will heal all eligible units on the same tile (city) an additional 10HP.[NEWLINE]A hospital can heal land, air and naval units.[NEWLINE]A hospital can heal all eligible friendly/allied units.[NEWLINE]A hospital does not work in a city during resistance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Combat IV and Combat V [\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit which has the Combat IV promotion and is eligible for healing will heal itself an additional 10HP if it is in [BOLD]neutral[\BOLD] (including friendly civ's) territory.[NEWLINE]A unit which has the Combat V promotion and is eligible for healing will heal itself an additional 10HP if in [BOLD]enemy[\BOLD] territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: Combat IV and Combat V do nothing when in home/allied territory (contrary to what one might expect). Both Combat IV and Combat V apply [BOLD]only[\BOLD] when in the territory described above.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Promotion-Heal[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choosing a promotion IMMEDIATELY heals 50% of the HP needed to reach 100HP. If the number of HP needed is odd, the number healed is rounded down. Eg. a unit with 21HP will heal to 21 + (100 - 21) * 0.5 = 60.5 "=" 60HP[NEWLINE]A unit need not be eligible for healing to receive the Promotion-Heal.[NEWLINE]Accepting promotions has no effect on a unit's eligibilty for healing, and the immediate Promotion-Heal is independent of the healing that happens at the beginning of your turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Extra Info[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upgrading a unit does not heal any HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]AI units and barbarians heal the same way a player's units do. For barbarians, all civs are enemies (for territory considerations).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Healing Formula[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are 4 parameters that affect a unit's healing rate; Base Heal Rate, Medic, Hospital and Combat promotions (IV or V).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let X be the number of HP a unit has which is eligible for healing.[NEWLINE]Let P be the number of HP the eligible unit will heal. Then,[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]P = min(100 - X, B + M + H + C)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]where[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]B = 5 if in enemy territory[NEWLINE]B = 10 if in neutral or friendly territory (but not a city)[NEWLINE]B = 15 if in home/allied territory (but not a city) or in a city during resistance[NEWLINE]B = 20 if in a home/allied/friendly city not in resistance[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]M = 10 if a medic is available to operate on the unit (In Warlords, if the medic is Medic III then M = 25)[NEWLINE]M = 0 otherwise[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]H = 10 if the unit is in a city with a hospital[NEWLINE]H = 0 otherwise[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]C = 10 if the unit has Combat IV and is in neutral (or friendly civ's) territory[NEWLINE]C = 10 if the unit has Combat V and is in enemy territory[NEWLINE]C = 0 otherwise[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit with X hit points which is eligible for healing will heal to X + P hit points at the beginning of the next turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let N be the number of turns required to heal a unit. Then,[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]N = ceiling[(100 - X) / (B + M + H + C)][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note the formula always holds because B + M + H + C is never 0, and 0 &lt; X =&lt; 100.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]N is the same as the number of turns the game will display for a unit to heal completely. Minor note: Units that are not eligible for healing will still display the same N so actually they will take N+1 turns to heal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For those interested, the Promotion-Heal has the following (obvious) formula.[NEWLINE]Let X be the HP of ANY unit which has a new promotion available. Selecting a promotion will IMMEDIATELY heal P hit points where[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]P = floor[(100 - X) * 0.5][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit will therefore have X + floor[(100 - X) * 0.5] hit points immediately after choosing a promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Observations[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A unit in enemy territory will take 20 turns to heal if it has less than 5HP. This is the maximum number of turns a unit could take to heal.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A unit in enemey territory will heal 3 times faster if he has a medic available. He will heal in 7 turns at the most, at a rate of 15HP per turn (as opposed to 5HP per turn without a medic).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A unit without Combat IV will heal fastest in a home or friendly city, with a hospital and a medic of your own or ally's (40HP per turn and maximum 3 turns to completely heal).[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A unit with Combat IV will heal faster in a friendly civ's city than your own![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The fastest any unit can heal is 50HP per turn. The unit must have Combat IV and be in a friendly civ's city that has a hospital and a medic of yours or your ally's. With this set up you will have a maximum heal time of 2 turns! 20HP from being in city, 10HP from medic, 10HP from hospital and 10HP from Combat IV. Total: 50HP[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]March is generally a useless promotion for your medic units. It is often confused but you should give March to units which you will want to BE healed. For example, send along a Medic I Explorer with your Mech Infantry or March-promoted units and you will have a force which heals quickly when on the move even in enemy territory.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you have damaged units in a friendly civ's territory, put them in one of the civ's cities. These cities are just as good as your own cities at healing your units![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Armored units and helicopters cannot be given Medic promotions. Armored units, helicopters and naval units cannot be given the March promotion.

With this set up you will have a maximum heal time of 2 turns! 20HP from being in city, 10HP from medic, 10HP from hospital and 10HP from Combat IV. Total: 50HP[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]March is generally a useless promotion for your medic units. It is often confused but you should give March to units which you will want to BE healed. For example, send along a Medic I Explorer with your Mech Infantry or March-promoted units and you will have a force which heals quickly when on the move even in enemy territory.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you have damaged units in a friendly civ's territory, put them in one of the civ's cities. These cities are just as good as your own cities at healing your units![NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Armored units and helicopters cannot be given Medic promotions. Armored units, helicopters and naval units cannot be given the March promotion. However, these promotions can be retained through unit upgrades eg. by upgrading march promoted cavalry to gunships.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Often it is wise to hold off on promoting a unit so that after a battle the immediate (and significant) Promotion-Heal can be used.</French>

		<Spanish>[H1]Unit Healing[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]PieceOfMind[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The purpose of this article is to cover all aspects of unit healing in Civ4. Although it was written for Vanilla Civ 4, it includes information relevant to the Warlords expansion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you accessed this article through the War Academy, it may be worth checking the associated thread for updates: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=157954[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I welcome any feedback. Please post to direct my attention to anything which is not accurate. Don't hesitate to add any tips you think would benefit the article or make it more comprehensive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I have included a list of useful tips/observations at the conclusion of the article for your convenience.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term [BOLD]friendly[\BOLD] will be used in this article to describe a civ with whom you are at peace. [BOLD]Allied[\BOLD] civs include teammates and civs with a permanent alliance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit which is damaged (less than 100HP) and [BOLD]eligible[\BOLD] (see below) for healing will be healed at the beginning of the next turn, after all other AIs/players/barbarians have had their turns. An eligible unit will stop healing only when it reaches 100HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit is [BOLD]eligible[\BOLD] for healing if it "forfeits" its turn. More explicitly, there are actions which disqualify a unit from being eligible for healing, and actions which have no effect on a unit's eligibility. Details below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Eligibility for Healing[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit that performs ANY of the following actions will NOT be eligible for healing:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Movement (this does not include the indirect movement of cargo in transports)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Attack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Pillage[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bombard[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Load or unload (including from ship to ship)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Airlift[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bombing/Air Strike (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Reconnaissance (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Re-basing (air units)[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Upgrade[NEWLINE][BOLD]EXCEPTION: The March promotion[\BOLD][NEWLINE]A unit with the March promotion is ALWAYS eligible for healing. Any of the above actions which ordinarily disqualify a unit from being allowed to heal instead have no effect. For example, a March-promoted Cavalry can move 1 tile, attack, and then still be eligible for healing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The following actions will [BOLD]not[\BOLD] affect a unit's eligibility for healing:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Fortify[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sleep[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sentry[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Defending from an attack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sitting in a cargo ship while it moves[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Accepting a promotion[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Intercept Mission (air units)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In most documentation on unit healing, a unit will be said to heal some "percentage" in a turn. eg. the manual will tell you Medic I heals units on the same tile by 10%. The percent healed is the same as the number of HP healed. eg. A medic will add 10HP to units it heals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit's heal rate is determined by adding its [BOLD]Base Heal Rate[\BOLD] to, if applicable, any [BOLD]medic[\BOLD] healing, [BOLD]hospital[\BOLD] healing and healing from [BOLD]Combat[\BOLD] promotions. Details below:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Base Heal Rate[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eligible units will heal:[NEWLINE]5HP per turn in enemy territory,[NEWLINE]10HP per turn in neutral territory (but not a city). Note: Neutral territory includes unclaimed territory and the territory of friendly civs, but not allied civs.[NEWLINE]15HP per turn in home/allied territory (but not a city) or in any city which is in resistance[NEWLINE]20HP per turn in a city which is not in resistance[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Medics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit with the Medic I promotion will heal all eligible units on the same tile by 10HP.[NEWLINE]A medic can move and then heal units on the tile it ends its turn on.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic I heals itself if eligible.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic II will heal all eligible units in any adjacent tiles by 10HP. Minor note: a unit with Medic II but not Medic I will NOT heal units on the same tile.[NEWLINE][BOLD]IMPORTANT NOTE: Units with Medic II cannot heal units across a land/sea boundary. Ships in port are considered to be on the land side of the land/sea boundary.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No more than one Medic unit can operate on a unit eligible for healing each turn.[NEWLINE]A unit with Medic I and II does not heal units on the same tile any quicker than if it had only Medic I.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any ships (including transport ships) with Medic I will heal eligible units in their cargo or on the same tile.[NEWLINE]A medic unit can heal land, air and naval units.[NEWLINE]Medics can heal the units of an allied civ.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Minor note: The Red Cross wonder only gives the Medic I promotion to units which are ordinarily allowed to accept that promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Warlords: In the Warlords expansion, the presence of a great general allows the Medic III Promotion for Medic II promoted units. The Medic III Promotion gives an additional 15HP of healing to units on the same tile and adjacent tiles, totalling 25HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Hospitals[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A hospital will heal all eligible units on the same tile (city) an additional 10HP.[NEWLINE]A hospital can heal land, air and naval units.[NEWLINE]A hospital can heal all eligible friendly/allied units.[NEWLINE]A hospital does not work in a city during resistance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Combat IV and Combat V [\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A unit which has the Combat IV promotion and is eligible for healing will heal itself an additional 10HP if it is in [BOLD]neutral[\BOLD] (including friendly civ's) territory.[NEWLINE]A unit which has the Combat V promotion and is eligible for healing will heal itself an additional 10HP if in [BOLD]enemy[\BOLD] territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: Combat IV and Combat V do nothing when in home/allied territory (contrary to what one might expect). Both Combat IV and Combat V apply [BOLD]only[\BOLD] when in the territory described above.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Promotion-Heal[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Choosing a promotion IMMEDIATELY heals 50% of the HP needed to reach 100HP. If the number of HP needed is odd, the number healed is rounded down. Eg. a unit with 21HP will heal to 21 + (100 - 21) * 0.5 = 60.5 "=" 60HP[NEWLINE]A unit need not be eligible for healing to receive the Promotion-Heal.[NEWLINE]Accepting promotions has no effect on a unit's eligibilty for healing, and the immediate Promotion-Heal is independent of the healing that happens at the beginning of your turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Extra Info[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upgrading a unit does not heal any HP.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]AI units and barbarians heal the same way a player's units do. For barbarians, all civs are enemies (for territory considerations).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Healing Formula[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are 4 parameters that affect a unit's healing rate; Base Heal Rate, Medic, Hospital and Combat promotions (IV or V).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let X be the number of HP a unit has which is eligible for healing.[NEWLINE]Let P be the number of HP the eligible unit will heal.

Then,[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]N = ceiling[(100 - X) / (B + M + H + C)][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note the formula always holds because B + M + H + C is never 0, and 0 &lt; X =&lt; 100.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]N is the same as the number of turns the game will display for a unit to heal completely.

		<English>[H1]Let's Make a World War[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]maltz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Peace is a lie, there is only passion.[NEWLINE]Through passion, I gain strength.[NEWLINE]Through strength, I gain power.[NEWLINE]Through power, I gain victory.[NEWLINE]Through victory, my chains are broken.[NEWLINE]The Force shall free me.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]-- The Sith Code (Star Wars)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Welcome to the dark side![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Making a World War isn't all about the childish destruction and hysterical laugh - that's why the bad guys always lose at the end of the movie.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Making a World War serves a purpose. The purpose is to give you the relative strength to overpower your neighbors, while they are busy killing each other. The purpose is to give you the victory otherwise impossible. Making a World War is plotted with a tactful, careful brain, and carried out with a steady, dirty index finger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And then comes your hysterical laugh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you make a World War by [BOLD]bribing a lot of countries to attack a lot of other countries, which threaten your advantage and might cost you a victory[\BOLD]. Obviously, there are 3 key elements of making a world war: (A) A Tech Lead, (B) The Invaders, and (C) The Victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](A) A Tech Lead[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can't initiate a world war by eye winking and spine bending. If your tech level falls behind everybody else, this article is unfortunately beyond you. You need to be more aggressive (axeman, horse archers, or settlers) at the very beginning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The AIs value techs very highly. Many of them are willing to declare a life-long enemy, as long as you give them 1-3 free techs. You don't have to be a global tech leader, since you only need to give free techs to those technologically-inferior Civs, not on the top of the score list. For those who are actually more advanced than you, they make perfect victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can always make a pseudo tech lead. Although you are not really more advanced in tech, you own some techs that the AIs don't. You do that by researching the AI-disfavored techs before the AIs do. The predictable AIs tend to follow a general research trend:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Writing -&gt; Mathematics -&gt; Calendar / Construction / Code of Laws -&gt; Philosophy[NEWLINE]Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guild -&gt; Gunpowder -&gt; Chemistry -&gt; Rifling[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why Alphabet is so useful. AIs avoid it, while it enables you to trade other techs at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Drama + Music is the next nice early bribery. Later on, you will bribe with Machinery + Civil service (dangerous military bribe as they give Maceman!), Paper + Education, Constitution, etc. Researching these AI disfavored techs first also gives you the chance to trade for techs that you missed. Even if you don't use them to bribe, you still gain advantages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](B) The Invaders[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As mentioned above, civs who lags behind you in tech have the potential to become invaders. There are a few exceptions - when the invader is extremely friendly to you, and quite hostile to the target. In that case the attack may be free.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may ask, "I still can't make them to attack, because they gave me red texts, instead of white, under the [Declare War to] section in the diplomatic interface."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]p.s. It is also possible to see white texts, but still get refused. This is because you don't have enough free techs for them to pick. You know what to do -- come back later with more free techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you move the mouse cursor over the red text, you will see the reason why the AI refuses to attack. It can be one of the following reasons:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse I: [COLOR_RED]"We just don't like you enough."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need to improve your relationship to this invader Civ. There are 4 ways to make friends:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The quickest way: Trade with them, and let them take some advantage. The modifier "Our trade relationship has been fair... (yeah right!)" goes up to +4. If you are playing on Deity, you always get a lot of positive feedbacks because AI never agrees a trade unless they rip you off. Note that gifts (city, cash, tech, resource) fall into this category. So if you already have a +4 here, there no need for additional gifts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. The slow way: Share the same state religion. The positive modifier "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" goes up with time, up to +8 for some leaders (such as Isabella), and almost doesn't matter for some others (such as Victoria).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. The lucky way: You have their favorite Civic. For example, Mansa Musa likes Civs with Free Market as their economic policy. The modifier goes up with time, up to +4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. The bonus way: Mutual military struggle - sharing the same enemy. This modifier is usually useless, since by the time you see it, probably you've already bribed the Civ to attack your target. However, if the Civ is aggressive enough to attack even before your bribery, this modifier could be the final kick making the invader Pleased with you. Thus it will be easier to ask them to attack someone else in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are other smaller modifiers that may make a difference, such as:[NEWLINE]- "You have supplied us with resources." (from resource trade)[NEWLINE]- "You gave us help." (from giving away techs based on their request/threats)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse II: [COLOR_RED]"We can't betray our close friends!"[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This Civ is having good relationship with your target. If you see this excuse, it is usually impossible to make the deal no matter how friendly you are to them, unless one of them suddenly decides to switch its state religion, thus nullifying that huge "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you see a Civ suddenly change their state religion after mid game - laugh out loud. Your golden chance has come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: Catherine is the only AI that ignores friendship to the target. In other words, it is possible to bribe her to go after her best friends.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse III: [COLOR_RED]"Our hands are busy with something else."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This means the AI is either currently at war, or has set out a defined target, and is on its way to declaring a war on the defined target. There is no way to bring the AI's willingness to take your bribe, unless you either pull them out of the current war, or cancel their defined target somehow. Sometimes, if your military falls behind, this target is very likely yourself![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just a side note:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can accurately predict an aggressive AI's attack, from the diplomatic screen. The warmongers are usually willing to take bribes, so you can see at least a few white fonts in the list of "declare war to". If all of a sudden, all targets are reded out, and you get the excuse of "our hands are busy with something else", then you know you are a little bit late on bribing. In one of my current games, I was attacked by Monty, then Genghis Khan. When I loaded back a few hundred years, I can pinpoint the exact turn where they decided to attack me, and I can go to the previous turn to bribe them to go after somebody else. The lesson here: always bribe them as early as possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse IV: [COLOR_RED]"We would have nothing to gain."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This excuse reflects an insufficient hatred against the target. Some leaders are not aggressive in nature, so they are very reluctant to attack a neutral, even slightly hostile Civ, even you are already Friendly with them. Aggressive AIs might also give you this response, if they really "have nothing to gain" from the war. Perhaps their distance is too far, or perhaps its power is too low compared to the target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to avoid this excuse, you should know a little personalities of different AI leaders. There are two kinds of AI that are ideal invaders. The "[BOLD]Peg Dogs[\BOLD]" and the "[BOLD]Zealots[\BOLD]".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Peg dogs are the more aggressive Civs, attacking any weak neighbor no matter how Pleased (not Friendly yet!) they are with them. Peg dogs are very dangerous when they have nothing to do -- they WILL come after you if you are weak, even you are on the other end of the continent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You recognize pet dogs by their constant barking at the door - "gimme this tech!" "gimme this cash!" Don't think they won't bite you when you hand them the bone. Throw the bone at your target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pet dogs grow into dinosaurs when they are given abundant resources to develop, but if you keep them under-developed by a continuous assignment of warfare, they will stay as your loyal friend. That is, if you make them your friend in the first place. If they are annoyed with you, you better make somebody else to go after them soon, and take good care of them yourself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous pet dog is Montezuma (Monty) of Aztec. Our chief pushes the definition of pet dog to extreme. Other good pet dogs include: Alexander of Greeks, Genghis Khan of Mongol, Louis XIV of France, Tokugawa of Japan, Victoria of England, Catherine of Russia, etc. Whoever give you a white text under the "declare war on" option for no apparent history of violence, you get yourself a pet dog right there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Zealots are one level more supplicated than pet dogs - and that one extra level is [BOLD]Religion[\BOLD]. Zealots are not necessarily aggressive in nature, but sure they hate pagans. If you are aligned with Zealots in religion, you've got yourself some solid, fine allies. Even better, almost all AI leaders has the potential of becoming a Zealot - as long as you share the religions long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The best example of zealot is Isabella of Spain. Many people hate her because they are used to go with their own religion... and their own religion usually is not the same as Isabella's religion. Ops. There will be a totally different story if you become Isabella's brother/sister in faith. She will attack anywhere you point your finger to. You will think she is the most beautiful woman in Civ4. Ok... at least I did at one point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chances are you will see quite a few potential invaders in any map. The most important factor here would be RELIGION. In essense, you [BOLD]religiously align yourself to the invaders, so they are happy enough to agree to attack your victims[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Be careful though - many Civs tend to adopt free religion after they get Liberalism. Free religion means less friendly and less annoyed. You have to match the invaders-victims earlier than Liberalism. Even after they switch, they still hate each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](C) The Victims[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cooperating invaders are hard to come by, so you must spend them carefully.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Victims in your World War are the Civs that actually threaten your victory. Is Mansa Musa or Gandhi running away with tech? You might even consider to make more than 2 Civs to attack them at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since your victim is usually a peace lover, it is likely that they have few enemies. It is possible that their missionaries will convert everyone to their religions in the near future, making everybody their friend. That can be really bad for you, because you can't bring them down! You must bribe early, before everybody is converted. If you are lucky, you get a few leaders who don't really care about backstabbing friends (such as Victoria). That will be really nice. Otherwise you will have to wait, until somebody converts to Confucianism, Christianity or Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, some additional information that might be useful:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Each war goes on for at least 10 turns, before a peace treaty can be made.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A less aggressive leader makes a peace treaty earlier and easier.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If one side is clearly winning, the losing AI is likely to bring up a treaty proposal. The winning AI tends NOT to accept the peace treaty if their complete victory (i.e. target elimination) is perceivable.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The AIs do give away Cheap techs in exchange for a treaty.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]AIs prefer to convert to a state religion that is found by themselves.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]When converting the state religion ourselves, it is really beneficial switch to organized religion and build tons of missionaries to spread it among your country, so all of your cities build 25% faster.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope you have enjoyed this guide. Thanks for reading.</English>

Although you are not really more advanced in tech, you own some techs that the AIs don't. You do that by researching the AI-disfavored techs before the AIs do. The predictable AIs tend to follow a general research trend:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Writing -&gt; Mathematics -&gt; Calendar / Construction / Code of Laws -&gt; Philosophy[NEWLINE]Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guild -&gt; Gunpowder -&gt; Chemistry -&gt; Rifling[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why Alphabet is so useful. AIs avoid it, while it enables you to trade other techs at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Drama + Music is the next nice early bribery. Later on, you will bribe with Machinery + Civil service (dangerous military bribe as they give Maceman!), Paper + Education, Constitution, etc. Researching these AI disfavored techs first also gives you the chance to trade for techs that you missed. Even if you don't use them to bribe, you still gain advantages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](B) The Invaders[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As mentioned above, civs who lags behind you in tech have the potential to become invaders. There are a few exceptions - when the invader is extremely friendly to you, and quite hostile to the target. In that case the attack may be free.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may ask, "I still can't make them to attack, because they gave me red texts, instead of white, under the [Declare War to] section in the diplomatic interface."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]p.s. It is also possible to see white texts, but still get refused. This is because you don't have enough free techs for them to pick. You know what to do -- come back later with more free techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you move the mouse cursor over the red text, you will see the reason why the AI refuses to attack. It can be one of the following reasons:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse I: [COLOR_RED]"We just don't like you enough."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need to improve your relationship to this invader Civ. There are 4 ways to make friends:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The quickest way: Trade with them, and let them take some advantage. The modifier "Our trade relationship has been fair... (yeah right!)" goes up to +4. If you are playing on Deity, you always get a lot of positive feedbacks because AI never agrees a trade unless they rip you off. Note that gifts (city, cash, tech, resource) fall into this category. So if you already have a +4 here, there no need for additional gifts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. The slow way: Share the same state religion. The positive modifier "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" goes up with time, up to +8 for some leaders (such as Isabella), and almost doesn't matter for some others (such as Victoria).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. The lucky way: You have their favorite Civic. For example, Mansa Musa likes Civs with Free Market as their economic policy. The modifier goes up with time, up to +4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. The bonus way: Mutual military struggle - sharing the same enemy. This modifier is usually useless, since by the time you see it, probably you've already bribed the Civ to attack your target. However, if the Civ is aggressive enough to attack even before your bribery, this modifier could be the final kick making the invader Pleased with you. Thus it will be easier to ask them to attack someone else in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are other smaller modifiers that may make a difference, such as:[NEWLINE]- "You have supplied us with resources." (from resource trade)[NEWLINE]- "You gave us help." (from giving away techs based on their request/threats)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse II: [COLOR_RED]"We can't betray our close friends!"[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This Civ is having good relationship with your target. If you see this excuse, it is usually impossible to make the deal no matter how friendly you are to them, unless one of them suddenly decides to switch its state religion, thus nullifying that huge "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you see a Civ suddenly change their state religion after mid game - laugh out loud. Your golden chance has come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: Catherine is the only AI that ignores friendship to the target. In other words, it is possible to bribe her to go after her best friends.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse III: [COLOR_RED]"Our hands are busy with something else."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This means the AI is either currently at war, or has set out a defined target, and is on its way to declaring a war on the defined target. There is no way to bring the AI's willingness to take your bribe, unless you either pull them out of the current war, or cancel their defined target somehow. Sometimes, if your military falls behind, this target is very likely yourself![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just a side note:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can accurately predict an aggressive AI's attack, from the diplomatic screen. The warmongers are usually willing to take bribes, so you can see at least a few white fonts in the list of "declare war to". If all of a sudden, all targets are reded out, and you get the excuse of "our hands are busy with something else", then you know you are a little bit late on bribing. In one of my current games, I was attacked by Monty, then Genghis Khan. When I loaded back a few hundred years, I can pinpoint the exact turn where they decided to attack me, and I can go to the previous turn to bribe them to go after somebody else. The lesson here: always bribe them as early as possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse IV: [COLOR_RED]"We would have nothing to gain."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This excuse reflects an insufficient hatred against the target. Some leaders are not aggressive in nature, so they are very reluctant to attack a neutral, even slightly hostile Civ, even you are already Friendly with them. Aggressive AIs might also give you this response, if they really "have nothing to gain" from the war. Perhaps their distance is too far, or perhaps its power is too low compared to the target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to avoid this excuse, you should know a little personalities of different AI leaders. There are two kinds of AI that are ideal invaders. The "[BOLD]Peg Dogs[\BOLD]" and the "[BOLD]Zealots[\BOLD]".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Peg dogs are the more aggressive Civs, attacking any weak neighbor no matter how Pleased (not Friendly yet!) they are with them. Peg dogs are very dangerous when they have nothing to do -- they WILL come after you if you are weak, even you are on the other end of the continent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You recognize pet dogs by their constant barking at the door - "gimme this tech!" "gimme this cash!" Don't think they won't bite you when you hand them the bone. Throw the bone at your target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pet dogs grow into dinosaurs when they are given abundant resources to develop, but if you keep them under-developed by a continuous assignment of warfare, they will stay as your loyal friend. That is, if you make them your friend in the first place. If they are annoyed with you, you better make somebody else to go after them soon, and take good care of them yourself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous pet dog is Montezuma (Monty) of Aztec. Our chief pushes the definition of pet dog to extreme. Other good pet dogs include: Alexander of Greeks, Genghis Khan of Mongol, Louis XIV of France, Tokugawa of Japan, Victoria of England, Catherine of Russia, etc. Whoever give you a white text under the "declare war on" option for no apparent history of violence, you get yourself a pet dog right there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Zealots are one level more supplicated than pet dogs - and that one extra level is [BOLD]Religion[\BOLD]. Zealots are not necessarily aggressive in nature, but sure they hate pagans. If you are aligned with Zealots in religion, you've got yourself some solid, fine allies. Even better, almost all AI leaders has the potential of becoming a Zealot - as long as you share the religions long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The best example of zealot is Isabella of Spain. Many people hate her because they are used to go with their own religion... and their own religion usually is not the same as Isabella's religion. Ops. There will be a totally different story if you become Isabella's brother/sister in faith. She will attack anywhere you point your finger to. You will think she is the most beautiful woman in Civ4. Ok... at least I did at one point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chances are you will see quite a few potential invaders in any map. The most important factor here would be RELIGION. In essense, you [BOLD]religiously align yourself to the invaders, so they are happy enough to agree to attack your victims[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Be careful though - many Civs tend to adopt free religion after they get Liberalism. Free religion means less friendly and less annoyed. You have to match the invaders-victims earlier than Liberalism. Even after they switch, they still hate each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](C) The Victims[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cooperating invaders are hard to come by, so you must spend them carefully.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Victims in your World War are the Civs that actually threaten your victory. Is Mansa Musa or Gandhi running away with tech? You might even consider to make more than 2 Civs to attack them at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since your victim is usually a peace lover, it is likely that they have few enemies. It is possible that their missionaries will convert everyone to their religions in the near future, making everybody their friend. That can be really bad for you, because you can't bring them down! You must bribe early, before everybody is converted. If you are lucky, you get a few leaders who don't really care about backstabbing friends (such as Victoria). That will be really nice. Otherwise you will have to wait, until somebody converts to Confucianism, Christianity or Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, some additional information that might be useful:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Each war goes on for at least 10 turns, before a peace treaty can be made.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A less aggressive leader makes a peace treaty earlier and easier.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If one side is clearly winning, the losing AI is likely to bring up a treaty proposal. The winning AI tends NOT to accept the peace treaty if their complete victory (i.e. target elimination) is perceivable.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The AIs do give away Cheap techs in exchange for a treaty.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]AIs prefer to convert to a state religion that is found by themselves.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]When converting the state religion ourselves, it is really beneficial switch to organized religion and build tons of missionaries to spread it among your country, so all of your cities build 25% faster.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope you have enjoyed this guide.

The purpose is to give you the relative strength to overpower your neighbors, while they are busy killing each other. The purpose is to give you the victory otherwise impossible. Making a World War is plotted with a tactful, careful brain, and carried out with a steady, dirty index finger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And then comes your hysterical laugh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you make a World War by [BOLD]bribing a lot of countries to attack a lot of other countries, which threaten your advantage and might cost you a victory[\BOLD]. Obviously, there are 3 key elements of making a world war: (A) A Tech Lead, (B) The Invaders, and (C) The Victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](A) A Tech Lead[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can't initiate a world war by eye winking and spine bending. If your tech level falls behind everybody else, this article is unfortunately beyond you. You need to be more aggressive (axeman, horse archers, or settlers) at the very beginning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The AIs value techs very highly. Many of them are willing to declare a life-long enemy, as long as you give them 1-3 free techs. You don't have to be a global tech leader, since you only need to give free techs to those technologically-inferior Civs, not on the top of the score list. For those who are actually more advanced than you, they make perfect victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can always make a pseudo tech lead. Although you are not really more advanced in tech, you own some techs that the AIs don't. You do that by researching the AI-disfavored techs before the AIs do.

Throw the bone at your target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pet dogs grow into dinosaurs when they are given abundant resources to develop, but if you keep them under-developed by a continuous assignment of warfare, they will stay as your loyal friend. That is, if you make them your friend in the first place. If they are annoyed with you, you better make somebody else to go after them soon, and take good care of them yourself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous pet dog is Montezuma (Monty) of Aztec. Our chief pushes the definition of pet dog to extreme. Other good pet dogs include: Alexander of Greeks, Genghis Khan of Mongol, Louis XIV of France, Tokugawa of Japan, Victoria of England, Catherine of Russia, etc. Whoever give you a white text under the "declare war on" option for no apparent history of violence, you get yourself a pet dog right there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Zealots are one level more supplicated than pet dogs - and that one extra level is [BOLD]Religion[\BOLD]. Zealots are not necessarily aggressive in nature, but sure they hate pagans. If you are aligned with Zealots in religion, you've got yourself some solid, fine allies. Even better, almost all AI leaders has the potential of becoming a Zealot - as long as you share the religions long enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The best example of zealot is Isabella of Spain. Many people hate her because they are used to go with their own religion... and their own religion usually is not the same as Isabella's religion. Ops. There will be a totally different story if you become Isabella's brother/sister in faith. She will attack anywhere you point your finger to. You will think she is the most beautiful woman in Civ4. Ok... at least I did at one point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chances are you will see quite a few potential invaders in any map. The most important factor here would be RELIGION. In essense, you [BOLD]religiously align yourself to the invaders, so they are happy enough to agree to attack your victims[\BOLD].[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Be careful though - many Civs tend to adopt free religion after they get Liberalism. Free religion means less friendly and less annoyed. You have to match the invaders-victims earlier than Liberalism. Even after they switch, they still hate each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](C) The Victims[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cooperating invaders are hard to come by, so you must spend them carefully.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Victims in your World War are the Civs that actually threaten your victory. Is Mansa Musa or Gandhi running away with tech? You might even consider to make more than 2 Civs to attack them at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since your victim is usually a peace lover, it is likely that they have few enemies. It is possible that their missionaries will convert everyone to their religions in the near future, making everybody their friend. That can be really bad for you, because you can't bring them down! You must bribe early, before everybody is converted. If you are lucky, you get a few leaders who don't really care about backstabbing friends (such as Victoria). That will be really nice. Otherwise you will have to wait, until somebody converts to Confucianism, Christianity or Islam.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, some additional information that might be useful:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Each war goes on for at least 10 turns, before a peace treaty can be made.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]A less aggressive leader makes a peace treaty earlier and easier.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If one side is clearly winning, the losing AI is likely to bring up a treaty proposal. The winning AI tends NOT to accept the peace treaty if their complete victory (i.e. target elimination) is perceivable.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The AIs do give away Cheap techs in exchange for a treaty.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]AIs prefer to convert to a state religion that is found by themselves.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]When converting the state religion ourselves, it is really beneficial switch to organized religion and build tons of missionaries to spread it among your country, so all of your cities build 25% faster.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I hope you have enjoyed this guide.

		<Spanish>[H1]Let's Make a World War[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]maltz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Peace is a lie, there is only passion.[NEWLINE]Through passion, I gain strength.[NEWLINE]Through strength, I gain power.[NEWLINE]Through power, I gain victory.[NEWLINE]Through victory, my chains are broken.[NEWLINE]The Force shall free me.[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]-- The Sith Code (Star Wars)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Welcome to the dark side![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Making a World War isn't all about the childish destruction and hysterical laugh - that's why the bad guys always lose at the end of the movie.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Making a World War serves a purpose. The purpose is to give you the relative strength to overpower your neighbors, while they are busy killing each other. The purpose is to give you the victory otherwise impossible. Making a World War is plotted with a tactful, careful brain, and carried out with a steady, dirty index finger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And then comes your hysterical laugh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In practice, you make a World War by [BOLD]bribing a lot of countries to attack a lot of other countries, which threaten your advantage and might cost you a victory[\BOLD]. Obviously, there are 3 key elements of making a world war: (A) A Tech Lead, (B) The Invaders, and (C) The Victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](A) A Tech Lead[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can't initiate a world war by eye winking and spine bending. If your tech level falls behind everybody else, this article is unfortunately beyond you. You need to be more aggressive (axeman, horse archers, or settlers) at the very beginning.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The AIs value techs very highly. Many of them are willing to declare a life-long enemy, as long as you give them 1-3 free techs. You don't have to be a global tech leader, since you only need to give free techs to those technologically-inferior Civs, not on the top of the score list. For those who are actually more advanced than you, they make perfect victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can always make a pseudo tech lead. Although you are not really more advanced in tech, you own some techs that the AIs don't. You do that by researching the AI-disfavored techs before the AIs do. The predictable AIs tend to follow a general research trend:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Writing -&gt; Mathematics -&gt; Calendar / Construction / Code of Laws -&gt; Philosophy[NEWLINE]Monarchy -&gt; Feudalism -&gt; Guild -&gt; Gunpowder -&gt; Chemistry -&gt; Rifling[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why Alphabet is so useful. AIs avoid it, while it enables you to trade other techs at the same time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Drama + Music is the next nice early bribery. Later on, you will bribe with Machinery + Civil service (dangerous military bribe as they give Maceman!), Paper + Education, Constitution, etc. Researching these AI disfavored techs first also gives you the chance to trade for techs that you missed. Even if you don't use them to bribe, you still gain advantages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD](B) The Invaders[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As mentioned above, civs who lags behind you in tech have the potential to become invaders. There are a few exceptions - when the invader is extremely friendly to you, and quite hostile to the target. In that case the attack may be free.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may ask, "I still can't make them to attack, because they gave me red texts, instead of white, under the [Declare War to] section in the diplomatic interface."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]p.s. It is also possible to see white texts, but still get refused. This is because you don't have enough free techs for them to pick. You know what to do -- come back later with more free techs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you move the mouse cursor over the red text, you will see the reason why the AI refuses to attack. It can be one of the following reasons:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse I: [COLOR_RED]"We just don't like you enough."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You need to improve your relationship to this invader Civ. There are 4 ways to make friends:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. The quickest way: Trade with them, and let them take some advantage. The modifier "Our trade relationship has been fair... (yeah right!)" goes up to +4. If you are playing on Deity, you always get a lot of positive feedbacks because AI never agrees a trade unless they rip you off. Note that gifts (city, cash, tech, resource) fall into this category. So if you already have a +4 here, there no need for additional gifts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. The slow way: Share the same state religion. The positive modifier "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" goes up with time, up to +8 for some leaders (such as Isabella), and almost doesn't matter for some others (such as Victoria).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. The lucky way: You have their favorite Civic. For example, Mansa Musa likes Civs with Free Market as their economic policy. The modifier goes up with time, up to +4.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. The bonus way: Mutual military struggle - sharing the same enemy. This modifier is usually useless, since by the time you see it, probably you've already bribed the Civ to attack your target. However, if the Civ is aggressive enough to attack even before your bribery, this modifier could be the final kick making the invader Pleased with you. Thus it will be easier to ask them to attack someone else in the future.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are other smaller modifiers that may make a difference, such as:[NEWLINE]- "You have supplied us with resources." (from resource trade)[NEWLINE]- "You gave us help." (from giving away techs based on their request/threats)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse II: [COLOR_RED]"We can't betray our close friends!"[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This Civ is having good relationship with your target. If you see this excuse, it is usually impossible to make the deal no matter how friendly you are to them, unless one of them suddenly decides to switch its state religion, thus nullifying that huge "We love our brothers and sisters of the same faith" modifier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you see a Civ suddenly change their state religion after mid game - laugh out loud. Your golden chance has come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: Catherine is the only AI that ignores friendship to the target. In other words, it is possible to bribe her to go after her best friends.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse III: [COLOR_RED]"Our hands are busy with something else."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This means the AI is either currently at war, or has set out a defined target, and is on its way to declaring a war on the defined target. There is no way to bring the AI's willingness to take your bribe, unless you either pull them out of the current war, or cancel their defined target somehow. Sometimes, if your military falls behind, this target is very likely yourself![NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just a side note:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can accurately predict an aggressive AI's attack, from the diplomatic screen. The warmongers are usually willing to take bribes, so you can see at least a few white fonts in the list of "declare war to". If all of a sudden, all targets are reded out, and you get the excuse of "our hands are busy with something else", then you know you are a little bit late on bribing. In one of my current games, I was attacked by Monty, then Genghis Khan. When I loaded back a few hundred years, I can pinpoint the exact turn where they decided to attack me, and I can go to the previous turn to bribe them to go after somebody else. The lesson here: always bribe them as early as possible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excuse IV: [COLOR_RED]"We would have nothing to gain."[COLOR_REVERT][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This excuse reflects an insufficient hatred against the target. Some leaders are not aggressive in nature, so they are very reluctant to attack a neutral, even slightly hostile Civ, even you are already Friendly with them. Aggressive AIs might also give you this response, if they really "have nothing to gain" from the war. Perhaps their distance is too far, or perhaps its power is too low compared to the target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to avoid this excuse, you should know a little personalities of different AI leaders. There are two kinds of AI that are ideal invaders. The "[BOLD]Peg Dogs[\BOLD]" and the "[BOLD]Zealots[\BOLD]".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Peg dogs are the more aggressive Civs, attacking any weak neighbor no matter how Pleased (not Friendly yet!) they are with them. Peg dogs are very dangerous when they have nothing to do -- they WILL come after you if you are weak, even you are on the other end of the continent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You recognize pet dogs by their constant barking at the door - "gimme this tech!" "gimme this cash!" Don't think they won't bite you when you hand them the bone. Throw the bone at your target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pet dogs grow into dinosaurs when they are given abundant resources to develop, but if you keep them under-developed by a continuous assignment of warfare, they will stay as your loyal friend. That is, if you make them your friend in the first place. If they are annoyed with you, you better make somebody else to go after them soon, and take good care of them yourself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most famous pet dog is Montezuma (Monty) of Aztec.

		<English>[H1]Warmonger's Guide for Industrial/Modern Era World War of Conquest[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most people prefer to finish the game ASAP and take whatever approach will get them the victory and maximum score. Some of us, however, enjoy the warfare aspects of Civ4. I like taking on the AI's instead of just shooting for a space race or diplomatic victory. War is fun and it's even more fun when you can fight with a wide variety of units, including tanks, modern armor, mech infantry, bombers, fighters, etc...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I measure my success by the exchange ratio. If I can take out every single AI while maintaining a kill ratio of 3:1, that's a stunning military victory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this is not really a guide on winning Civ4, because there are many other guides. This is all about war. How you fight a war against a well armed AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Modern era[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Armor units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Modern Armor and Tank should be promoted in 3 different styles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are the one you expect to die in large numbers due to leading assault on a city fortified with Mech Infantry. They should receive City Raider, and Barrage. If you chose civics such that you can have a third promotion right out of production, choose Combat I. If an unit survives enough assaults to get another promotion, choose Pinch. Blitz will be a non-factor because these shock troops won't have enough HP to make a 2nd attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cleanup troops are the ones who will go in when all defenders are at a fraction of their initial strength. Promotion order is Drill I, Drill II, Combat I, Drill III, Pinch. These units will usually survive and eventually become highly promoted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are the units you built in the city with West Point. You only need 1 or 2 of each. Combat I, Combat II, Charge makes a specific anti-siege unit. Substitute Formation if you want an anti-Cavalry Tank unit, but it's unlikely you'll need many of these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The unit mix should be 3:1 in terms of shock troops versus cleanup, since the core cities you'll be assaulting usually will have 6-8 defenders. Expect to lose 40-60% of your shock troops in any given assault against entrenched Mech Infantry which has been softened up already with either an artillery suicide-charge or stealth-bomber air strikes, so plan accordingly when it comes to your post-conquest goals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the assault is against regular Infantry or Marine, then the loss ratio for shock troops should be in the 20-40% range. The shock troops should NOT be moved after the assault. Leave 2-3 full-strength gunpowder units in place, one of them with medic upgrade, to maximize healing. The only exception is in beachhead assault, where you must put everyone into the city in order to wait out the counter-attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Gunpowder Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Infantry and Mech Infantry are in the same basic category. They are usually considered defensive units, but they are much more versatile than that. There are 3 basic types of Gunpowder units, and your options are going to be complex since you'll likely have legacy units you upgraded. So the unit mix won't be quite as static as armored units, which you can plan from day 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Especially valuable are those units who have been promoted from archers and longbowmen because those units can have Drill upgrades, which they keep even as Gunpowder units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are designated for city assault. These units are essential when facing a city with wall/castle because the 50% bonus can't be reduced with bombardment. Sending anything except for gunpowder units makes the city a meat grinder. Combat I, Pinch, City Assault is the promotion order. Expect 85%+ casualty from units which make the assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Garrison troops are used to hold the captured territory. City Garrison, Combat I, and Medic are the promotion order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are given Guerilla I and Guerilla II for a special hill-cover unit. , or the Woodman equivalent. For Infantry, in the pre-Gunship era, you may want to get Combat I, Combat II, and Pinch for a specialty anti-tank unit. Once promoted to Mech Inf, you can now fight Modern Armor on equal footing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gunpowder units are needed on a minimum of 1:4 ratio with the armor units in a large-scale assault. If you have 12 armor units (9 shock, 3 cleanup) then expect to carry at least 3 Gunpowder units. If this is the initial landing on enemy territory separated by ocean, the ratio needs to be reversed to 3:1 in favor of gunpowder (12 gunpowder for every 3 armor) in order to weather the initial assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Always keep the Infantry unit's +25% vs gunpowder in mind. Against an infantry unit entrenched in a city guarded by walls, the defender has the 50% bonus in addition to the normal entrenchment. At 100% strength, that gives the defender 35 = 20 (base) + 10 (wall) + 5 (entrench) versus the armor unit's 28. Bad odds. Even if you reduce the infantry defender's base to 60%, it's still 28 vs. 21 (defender).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An assault with an Infantry unit against the same 60% defender, the odds are better at 25 vs. 18 because the wall bonus no longer applies. Even better if the attacker has Pinch and the defender has Garrison because you apply the 25% bonus to a higher base and the defender's bonus is only 20%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the defenders are composed of Marines or SAM Infantry, the advantage is even more pronounced. The Marines have a higher base, but the Infantry's 25% bonus makes up the difference. SAM Infantry has a lower base and no gunpowder bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mounted and Helicopter Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the modern era, both you and the AI can have a large number of gunships just because the inventory of cavalry units which was subsequently promoted. In some cases, it's better not to promote because the main use of such mounted units in the modern era is defensive or for pillage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gunship is touted as an anti-armor unit, and there are no good promotion strategy other than Drill. Anything else is useless because it usually doesn't survive combat. The AI is smart enough to cover their tanks with SAM infantry and other gunpowder units, so you'll rarely get a chance to use your gunships against them anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use gunships for raiding. Uniquely, they can move immediately upon unloading from a transport. The initial transoceanic assault will trigger a massive response and gunships will help you survive it by cutting all rail lines around the city you'll be assaulting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use 1 movement to unload, 1 more to get into position, and the remaining 2 to pillage. You need to cut ALL the railroads into the entry city to prevent the 1 MP units from reinforcing. Of course, you should have cut the lines around your initial landing site first.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the initial landing, take the surviving gunpowder units to cover the gunships into proximity any nice geographic features like hills. Create a fire break wherever possible by cutting railroads. Gunships are the only unit which can cut an improved tile in a single turn, although you should plan to sacrifice them. Stalling the enemy counter-attack is well worth doing even if you lose several gunships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you start a war without Gunships, Cavalry is your only option. Once Infantry is in play, Cavalry is useless anyways and their only use is to pillage. If you have any older units left like Horse Archers, etc..., now is the time to use them. You have to use (and lose) twice as many mounted units, but the result will be the same. It's a shame that Explorers can't pillage, because they'd otherwise be the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Important Note:[\BOLD] Due to a bug in the patch, a group (2 more more) of gunships without stack-attack turned on can actually occupy a city. Thus it's actually possible for an all-gunship assault to take enemy territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Siege Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In modern warfare, there is really only 1 siege unit - the artillery. The Machine Gun is worthless and don't even bother bringing it when planning an assault. Its usefulness is strictly against the likes of Cavalry and Rifleman. Once you have infantry, you don't need MG's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The artillery, however, should be your best friend. On an assault, sacrificing 3-4 artillery units is worth it as long as you save a couple of tanks or mech. infantry units from destruction. The slow movement isn't going to matter in your initial beachhead assault, and your operating tempo will slow down to allow units to heal anyways, so you have time to let large artillery divisions move forward. Unlike the catapult or Cannon, the Artillery has enough strength to make a halfway decent defender, and none of the "modern" units have anti-siege bonuses built in. Artillery comes in two varieties - general and assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]General artillery should have Accuracy and Barrage. That makes them suitable both as bombardment if you don't have bombers (or don't want to use them) and as shock troops. The assault artillery is either units built in the West Point city or a general artillery which got promoted enough to get Barrage II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In an assault after all cultural bonus has been worn down, pick your highest Barrage artillery unit and send them in to die. Expect 60-80% mortality rate, and the goal is to wear down the defenders such that you have a definite superiority in attack strength. For every 3 units in the city, expect to use 1 artillery assault. So if a city is defended by 9 units, plan to use at least 3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A crucial point is that in the initial beachhead assault, you MUST hold at least 4 artillery units in reserve because the AI will inevitably send its most powerful counter-attack immediately. Assuming you brought the right unit mix, the gunships should have cut the roads. That will force the AI to stack up its units instead of just rushing in for the attack. This is where the artillery saves your beachhead by doing so much collateral damage to the stacked up units that you get breathing room to have your transports make another round-trip with reinforcements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the convoy system, the only 2 units that matter are Battleship and Transport. You don't need to have carriers, destroyers, etc... unless you seek naval superiority, which really isn't necessary. By the time you are in a modern world war, the health bonus from fish, clam, etc... are no longer critical so the AI is welcome to parade their naval units up and down the coast without interference. If they deny your border cities of the sea-based foods, it's likely that war weariness will reduce your workforce to the point where it doesn't matter anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transports should be given Flanking and Navigation I to bring them up to 6 MP. That puts their range the same as the Battleship, which should receive all the Drill Bonuses possible. You won't need flank or navigation because the BB's aren't going anywhere once they are on station.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In general, you should choose a common embarkation point for transports. Every 6 MP's, station 2 BB's as the convoy guard point. If the ocean is 3 transits wide, you'll need 2 BB stations with a total of 6 units in order to provide relief. All transports, coming and going, will hald on the BB-guarded spots. In general, the AI doesn't like to take on guarded transports without good odds and 2 BB's are long odds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if those are the only places where naval units are found, then the AI will go for them. That's why you should be producing transports for use strictly as bait. Load them up as they are built with a single low-value unit and just send them into the deep blue seas. Losing them keeps the AI navy busy elsewhere while you truck in dozens of new units. To sustain an assault, airlifts alone aren't enough unless you want a grinding war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also remember that the transports have enough attack points that if there is a severely injured BB or destroyer hanging around, feel free to just take him out with an empty transport.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Air Warfare[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most of the strategy articles talk about Stealth Bomber, but that is at the end of the tech tree. Surely people have gone to war while armed strictly with Tanks, Artillery, Infantry, and Bombers?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Industrial Era, the Bomber is of limited utility. It takes at least 6 attacks to reduce a 100% cultural defense down to zero, and that assumes you can obtain a good base. You'll spend a lot of time rebasing bombers, because a base suitable for assaulting one city won't be suitable for another. Given how much the AI likes to use SAM Infantry, the Bomber is in deadly danger as soon as they have Rocketry, which comes a LOT sooner than Stealth Bomber. The Bomber is also relatively worthless in an air strike role unless the enemy AI is so far behind as to NOT have SAM Infantry or Fighters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Prince or above, how likely is it that an AI which you'd have to plan a trans-oceanic assault on doesn't have SAM Infantry?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Bombers are almost a complete waste of time in the city assault role. You'd be better off using the production capacity to produce an artillery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters are also nearly completely worthless. They spend too much time trying to re-base as operations move forward, and the production is better spent on another SAM Infantry or Mech. Infantry unit if you wanted anti-air protection. Unlike fighters, those units are actually useful for something else.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The only air unit even worth building is the Stealth Bomber, which is of course set to be wayyyy too powerful. With a big stack of stealth bombers (12+) not even a city protected by Jet Fighters can reasonable hope to protect it from bombardment. As long as you rest the Stealth Bombers to heal any time they take damage, you can expect to lose less than 1-in-10 even after 40+ rounds of combat. There's no need to discuss how to use these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tactics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some random thoughts, in no particular order[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dealing with Gunships[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sending out any kind of an armor force of Tanks or even Modern Armor without protection is an open invitation for AI gunships to swoop in, and as discussed, the AI always has a lot of gunships since they are upgrades from Cavalry. How to deal with them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A lot of people like to use SAM Infantry, because of the 50% bonus. Bad idea. Even with the bonus, they don't measure up to the Mech Infantry's attack power. And SAM Infantry can't keep up with tank units. Best to leave these guys back in your conquered cities as air cover.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't have the Mech Infantry unit, you should bring along extra Gunships instead. It's a fair fight, and Gunships have little combat role in the city assault anyways since they can't attack an entrenched SAM unit with any kind of success. As part of a stack with tanks, the enemy SAM Infantry can't get at them and you just need to have more Gunships than the enemy can bring the bear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the event there are gunships covering a city, expect to spend a couple more artillery so that your own tanks have a fighting chance at beating them. Infantry against gunship is not a good deal either, and it's better to spend more artillery units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Railroad Raider[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the vital necessity of creating a fire-break around your beachhead city, you should have obtained a world map at some point which gives you a look at the terrain. Look for choke points where the road network narrows and plan to drop a transport with a few gunships on that spot. Because of the 4 MP's, a gunship can unload, pillage, and get back on the transport in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any enemy choke point which comes too close to the ocean is your prey. Stay away from squares with towns. Although the plunder is nice, it takes too long to get all the way down to the railroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike previous versions of Civ, you can't cross an entire continent on rails in a single turn. Any degradation of the rail network which causes units to detour is worth doing. A transport loaded with 4 gunships can move down the coast and blow away 2-3 squares worth of railroads in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Feint[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use the railroad movement cost to your advantage. In Civ4, it's much harder to reinforce. If you have the units, start a false landing with ONLY the crap-units you can't use (machine guns, un-upgraded cannons, old riflemen, unneeded cavalry) in an inaccessible spot near a bad city. The AI will respond in force regardless, and it'll draw all those 1 MP units too far from your actual beachhead to respond the same turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That extra turn gives you the breathing space make sure you cut rail links. This tactic is best combined with Railroad Raider. If you draw them out and then cut the roads behind them, you can comfortably settle in before they reach you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Research Priority[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Considering the relative useless nature of bombers, is it really necessary to research Radio early on?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of 6k on Radio, get Rocketry first because Gunships are a lot more valuable.</English>
		<French>[H1]Warmonger's Guide for Industrial/Modern Era World War of Conquest[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most people prefer to finish the game ASAP and take whatever approach will get them the victory and maximum score. Some of us, however, enjoy the warfare aspects of Civ4. I like taking on the AI's instead of just shooting for a space race or diplomatic victory. War is fun and it's even more fun when you can fight with a wide variety of units, including tanks, modern armor, mech infantry, bombers, fighters, etc...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I measure my success by the exchange ratio. If I can take out every single AI while maintaining a kill ratio of 3:1, that's a stunning military victory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this is not really a guide on winning Civ4, because there are many other guides. This is all about war. How you fight a war against a well armed AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Modern era[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Armor units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Modern Armor and Tank should be promoted in 3 different styles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are the one you expect to die in large numbers due to leading assault on a city fortified with Mech Infantry. They should receive City Raider, and Barrage. If you chose civics such that you can have a third promotion right out of production, choose Combat I. If an unit survives enough assaults to get another promotion, choose Pinch. Blitz will be a non-factor because these shock troops won't have enough HP to make a 2nd attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cleanup troops are the ones who will go in when all defenders are at a fraction of their initial strength. Promotion order is Drill I, Drill II, Combat I, Drill III, Pinch. These units will usually survive and eventually become highly promoted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are the units you built in the city with West Point. You only need 1 or 2 of each. Combat I, Combat II, Charge makes a specific anti-siege unit. Substitute Formation if you want an anti-Cavalry Tank unit, but it's unlikely you'll need many of these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The unit mix should be 3:1 in terms of shock troops versus cleanup, since the core cities you'll be assaulting usually will have 6-8 defenders. Expect to lose 40-60% of your shock troops in any given assault against entrenched Mech Infantry which has been softened up already with either an artillery suicide-charge or stealth-bomber air strikes, so plan accordingly when it comes to your post-conquest goals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the assault is against regular Infantry or Marine, then the loss ratio for shock troops should be in the 20-40% range. The shock troops should NOT be moved after the assault. Leave 2-3 full-strength gunpowder units in place, one of them with medic upgrade, to maximize healing. The only exception is in beachhead assault, where you must put everyone into the city in order to wait out the counter-attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Gunpowder Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Infantry and Mech Infantry are in the same basic category. They are usually considered defensive units, but they are much more versatile than that. There are 3 basic types of Gunpowder units, and your options are going to be complex since you'll likely have legacy units you upgraded. So the unit mix won't be quite as static as armored units, which you can plan from day 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Especially valuable are those units who have been promoted from archers and longbowmen because those units can have Drill upgrades, which they keep even as Gunpowder units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are designated for city assault. These units are essential when facing a city with wall/castle because the 50% bonus can't be reduced with bombardment. Sending anything except for gunpowder units makes the city a meat grinder. Combat I, Pinch, City Assault is the promotion order. Expect 85%+ casualty from units which make the assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Garrison troops are used to hold the captured territory. City Garrison, Combat I, and Medic are the promotion order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are given Guerilla I and Guerilla II for a special hill-cover unit. , or the Woodman equivalent. For Infantry, in the pre-Gunship era, you may want to get Combat I, Combat II, and Pinch for a specialty anti-tank unit. Once promoted to Mech Inf, you can now fight Modern Armor on equal footing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gunpowder units are needed on a minimum of 1:4 ratio with the armor units in a large-scale assault. If you have 12 armor units (9 shock, 3 cleanup) then expect to carry at least 3 Gunpowder units. If this is the initial landing on enemy territory separated by ocean, the ratio needs to be reversed to 3:1 in favor of gunpowder (12 gunpowder for every 3 armor) in order to weather the initial assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Always keep the Infantry unit's +25% vs gunpowder in mind. Against an infantry unit entrenched in a city guarded by walls, the defender has the 50% bonus in addition to the normal entrenchment. At 100% strength, that gives the defender 35 = 20 (base) + 10 (wall) + 5 (entrench) versus the armor unit's 28. Bad odds. Even if you reduce the infantry defender's base to 60%, it's still 28 vs. 21 (defender).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An assault with an Infantry unit against the same 60% defender, the odds are better at 25 vs. 18 because the wall bonus no longer applies. Even better if the attacker has Pinch and the defender has Garrison because you apply the 25% bonus to a higher base and the defender's bonus is only 20%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the defenders are composed of Marines or SAM Infantry, the advantage is even more pronounced. The Marines have a higher base, but the Infantry's 25% bonus makes up the difference. SAM Infantry has a lower base and no gunpowder bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mounted and Helicopter Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the modern era, both you and the AI can have a large number of gunships just because the inventory of cavalry units which was subsequently promoted. In some cases, it's better not to promote because the main use of such mounted units in the modern era is defensive or for pillage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gunship is touted as an anti-armor unit, and there are no good promotion strategy other than Drill. Anything else is useless because it usually doesn't survive combat. The AI is smart enough to cover their tanks with SAM infantry and other gunpowder units, so you'll rarely get a chance to use your gunships against them anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use gunships for raiding. Uniquely, they can move immediately upon unloading from a transport. The initial transoceanic assault will trigger a massive response and gunships will help you survive it by cutting all rail lines around the city you'll be assaulting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use 1 movement to unload, 1 more to get into position, and the remaining 2 to pillage. You need to cut ALL the railroads into the entry city to prevent the 1 MP units from reinforcing. Of course, you should have cut the lines around your initial landing site first.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the initial landing, take the surviving gunpowder units to cover the gunships into proximity any nice geographic features like hills. Create a fire break wherever possible by cutting railroads. Gunships are the only unit which can cut an improved tile in a single turn, although you should plan to sacrifice them. Stalling the enemy counter-attack is well worth doing even if you lose several gunships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you start a war without Gunships, Cavalry is your only option. Once Infantry is in play, Cavalry is useless anyways and their only use is to pillage. If you have any older units left like Horse Archers, etc..., now is the time to use them. You have to use (and lose) twice as many mounted units, but the result will be the same. It's a shame that Explorers can't pillage, because they'd otherwise be the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Important Note:[\BOLD] Due to a bug in the patch, a group (2 more more) of gunships without stack-attack turned on can actually occupy a city. Thus it's actually possible for an all-gunship assault to take enemy territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Siege Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In modern warfare, there is really only 1 siege unit - the artillery. The Machine Gun is worthless and don't even bother bringing it when planning an assault. Its usefulness is strictly against the likes of Cavalry and Rifleman. Once you have infantry, you don't need MG's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The artillery, however, should be your best friend. On an assault, sacrificing 3-4 artillery units is worth it as long as you save a couple of tanks or mech. infantry units from destruction. The slow movement isn't going to matter in your initial beachhead assault, and your operating tempo will slow down to allow units to heal anyways, so you have time to let large artillery divisions move forward. Unlike the catapult or Cannon, the Artillery has enough strength to make a halfway decent defender, and none of the "modern" units have anti-siege bonuses built in. Artillery comes in two varieties - general and assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]General artillery should have Accuracy and Barrage. That makes them suitable both as bombardment if you don't have bombers (or don't want to use them) and as shock troops. The assault artillery is either units built in the West Point city or a general artillery which got promoted enough to get Barrage II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In an assault after all cultural bonus has been worn down, pick your highest Barrage artillery unit and send them in to die. Expect 60-80% mortality rate, and the goal is to wear down the defenders such that you have a definite superiority in attack strength. For every 3 units in the city, expect to use 1 artillery assault. So if a city is defended by 9 units, plan to use at least 3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A crucial point is that in the initial beachhead assault, you MUST hold at least 4 artillery units in reserve because the AI will inevitably send its most powerful counter-attack immediately. Assuming you brought the right unit mix, the gunships should have cut the roads. That will force the AI to stack up its units instead of just rushing in for the attack. This is where the artillery saves your beachhead by doing so much collateral damage to the stacked up units that you get breathing room to have your transports make another round-trip with reinforcements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the convoy system, the only 2 units that matter are Battleship and Transport. You don't need to have carriers, destroyers, etc... unless you seek naval superiority, which really isn't necessary. By the time you are in a modern world war, the health bonus from fish, clam, etc... are no longer critical so the AI is welcome to parade their naval units up and down the coast without interference. If they deny your border cities of the sea-based foods, it's likely that war weariness will reduce your workforce to the point where it doesn't matter anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transports should be given Flanking and Navigation I to bring them up to 6 MP. That puts their range the same as the Battleship, which should receive all the Drill Bonuses possible. You won't need flank or navigation because the BB's aren't going anywhere once they are on station.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In general, you should choose a common embarkation point for transports. Every 6 MP's, station 2 BB's as the convoy guard point. If the ocean is 3 transits wide, you'll need 2 BB stations with a total of 6 units in order to provide relief. All transports, coming and going, will hald on the BB-guarded spots. In general, the AI doesn't like to take on guarded transports without good odds and 2 BB's are long odds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if those are the only places where naval units are found, then the AI will go for them. That's why you should be producing transports for use strictly as bait. Load them up as they are built with a single low-value unit and just send them into the deep blue seas. Losing them keeps the AI navy busy elsewhere while you truck in dozens of new units. To sustain an assault, airlifts alone aren't enough unless you want a grinding war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also remember that the transports have enough attack points that if there is a severely injured BB or destroyer hanging around, feel free to just take him out with an empty transport.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Air Warfare[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most of the strategy articles talk about Stealth Bomber, but that is at the end of the tech tree. Surely people have gone to war while armed strictly with Tanks, Artillery, Infantry, and Bombers?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Industrial Era, the Bomber is of limited utility. It takes at least 6 attacks to reduce a 100% cultural defense down to zero, and that assumes you can obtain a good base. You'll spend a lot of time rebasing bombers, because a base suitable for assaulting one city won't be suitable for another. Given how much the AI likes to use SAM Infantry, the Bomber is in deadly danger as soon as they have Rocketry, which comes a LOT sooner than Stealth Bomber. The Bomber is also relatively worthless in an air strike role unless the enemy AI is so far behind as to NOT have SAM Infantry or Fighters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Prince or above, how likely is it that an AI which you'd have to plan a trans-oceanic assault on doesn't have SAM Infantry?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Bombers are almost a complete waste of time in the city assault role. You'd be better off using the production capacity to produce an artillery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters are also nearly completely worthless. They spend too much time trying to re-base as operations move forward, and the production is better spent on another SAM Infantry or Mech. Infantry unit if you wanted anti-air protection. Unlike fighters, those units are actually useful for something else.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The only air unit even worth building is the Stealth Bomber, which is of course set to be wayyyy too powerful. With a big stack of stealth bombers (12+) not even a city protected by Jet Fighters can reasonable hope to protect it from bombardment. As long as you rest the Stealth Bombers to heal any time they take damage, you can expect to lose less than 1-in-10 even after 40+ rounds of combat. There's no need to discuss how to use these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tactics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some random thoughts, in no particular order[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dealing with Gunships[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sending out any kind of an armor force of Tanks or even Modern Armor without protection is an open invitation for AI gunships to swoop in, and as discussed, the AI always has a lot of gunships since they are upgrades from Cavalry. How to deal with them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A lot of people like to use SAM Infantry, because of the 50% bonus. Bad idea. Even with the bonus, they don't measure up to the Mech Infantry's attack power. And SAM Infantry can't keep up with tank units. Best to leave these guys back in your conquered cities as air cover.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't have the Mech Infantry unit, you should bring along extra Gunships instead. It's a fair fight, and Gunships have little combat role in the city assault anyways since they can't attack an entrenched SAM unit with any kind of success. As part of a stack with tanks, the enemy SAM Infantry can't get at them and you just need to have more Gunships than the enemy can bring the bear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the event there are gunships covering a city, expect to spend a couple more artillery so that your own tanks have a fighting chance at beating them. Infantry against gunship is not a good deal either, and it's better to spend more artillery units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Railroad Raider[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the vital necessity of creating a fire-break around your beachhead city, you should have obtained a world map at some point which gives you a look at the terrain. Look for choke points where the road network narrows and plan to drop a transport with a few gunships on that spot. Because of the 4 MP's, a gunship can unload, pillage, and get back on the transport in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any enemy choke point which comes too close to the ocean is your prey. Stay away from squares with towns. Although the plunder is nice, it takes too long to get all the way down to the railroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike previous versions of Civ, you can't cross an entire continent on rails in a single turn. Any degradation of the rail network which causes units to detour is worth doing. A transport loaded with 4 gunships can move down the coast and blow away 2-3 squares worth of railroads in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Feint[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use the railroad movement cost to your advantage. In Civ4, it's much harder to reinforce.

The Bomber is also relatively worthless in an air strike role unless the enemy AI is so far behind as to NOT have SAM Infantry or Fighters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Prince or above, how likely is it that an AI which you'd have to plan a trans-oceanic assault on doesn't have SAM Infantry?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Bombers are almost a complete waste of time in the city assault role. You'd be better off using the production capacity to produce an artillery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters are also nearly completely worthless. They spend too much time trying to re-base as operations move forward, and the production is better spent on another SAM Infantry or Mech. Infantry unit if you wanted anti-air protection. Unlike fighters, those units are actually useful for something else.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The only air unit even worth building is the Stealth Bomber, which is of course set to be wayyyy too powerful. With a big stack of stealth bombers (12+) not even a city protected by Jet Fighters can reasonable hope to protect it from bombardment. As long as you rest the Stealth Bombers to heal any time they take damage, you can expect to lose less than 1-in-10 even after 40+ rounds of combat. There's no need to discuss how to use these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tactics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some random thoughts, in no particular order[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dealing with Gunships[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sending out any kind of an armor force of Tanks or even Modern Armor without protection is an open invitation for AI gunships to swoop in, and as discussed, the AI always has a lot of gunships since they are upgrades from Cavalry. How to deal with them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A lot of people like to use SAM Infantry, because of the 50% bonus. Bad idea. Even with the bonus, they don't measure up to the Mech Infantry's attack power. And SAM Infantry can't keep up with tank units. Best to leave these guys back in your conquered cities as air cover.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't have the Mech Infantry unit, you should bring along extra Gunships instead. It's a fair fight, and Gunships have little combat role in the city assault anyways since they can't attack an entrenched SAM unit with any kind of success. As part of a stack with tanks, the enemy SAM Infantry can't get at them and you just need to have more Gunships than the enemy can bring the bear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the event there are gunships covering a city, expect to spend a couple more artillery so that your own tanks have a fighting chance at beating them. Infantry against gunship is not a good deal either, and it's better to spend more artillery units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Railroad Raider[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the vital necessity of creating a fire-break around your beachhead city, you should have obtained a world map at some point which gives you a look at the terrain. Look for choke points where the road network narrows and plan to drop a transport with a few gunships on that spot. Because of the 4 MP's, a gunship can unload, pillage, and get back on the transport in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any enemy choke point which comes too close to the ocean is your prey. Stay away from squares with towns. Although the plunder is nice, it takes too long to get all the way down to the railroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike previous versions of Civ, you can't cross an entire continent on rails in a single turn. Any degradation of the rail network which causes units to detour is worth doing. A transport loaded with 4 gunships can move down the coast and blow away 2-3 squares worth of railroads in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Feint[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use the railroad movement cost to your advantage. In Civ4, it's much harder to reinforce. If you have the units, start a false landing with ONLY the crap-units you can't use (machine guns, un-upgraded cannons, old riflemen, unneeded cavalry) in an inaccessible spot near a bad city. The AI will respond in force regardless, and it'll draw all those 1 MP units too far from your actual beachhead to respond the same turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That extra turn gives you the breathing space make sure you cut rail links. This tactic is best combined with Railroad Raider. If you draw them out and then cut the roads behind them, you can comfortably settle in before they reach you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Research Priority[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Considering the relative useless nature of bombers, is it really necessary to research Radio early on?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of 6k on Radio, get Rocketry first because Gunships are a lot more valuable.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Warmonger's Guide for Industrial/Modern Era World War of Conquest[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most people prefer to finish the game ASAP and take whatever approach will get them the victory and maximum score. Some of us, however, enjoy the warfare aspects of Civ4. I like taking on the AI's instead of just shooting for a space race or diplomatic victory. War is fun and it's even more fun when you can fight with a wide variety of units, including tanks, modern armor, mech infantry, bombers, fighters, etc...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I measure my success by the exchange ratio. If I can take out every single AI while maintaining a kill ratio of 3:1, that's a stunning military victory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So this is not really a guide on winning Civ4, because there are many other guides. This is all about war. How you fight a war against a well armed AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Modern era[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Armor units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Modern Armor and Tank should be promoted in 3 different styles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are the one you expect to die in large numbers due to leading assault on a city fortified with Mech Infantry. They should receive City Raider, and Barrage. If you chose civics such that you can have a third promotion right out of production, choose Combat I. If an unit survives enough assaults to get another promotion, choose Pinch. Blitz will be a non-factor because these shock troops won't have enough HP to make a 2nd attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cleanup troops are the ones who will go in when all defenders are at a fraction of their initial strength. Promotion order is Drill I, Drill II, Combat I, Drill III, Pinch. These units will usually survive and eventually become highly promoted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are the units you built in the city with West Point. You only need 1 or 2 of each. Combat I, Combat II, Charge makes a specific anti-siege unit. Substitute Formation if you want an anti-Cavalry Tank unit, but it's unlikely you'll need many of these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The unit mix should be 3:1 in terms of shock troops versus cleanup, since the core cities you'll be assaulting usually will have 6-8 defenders. Expect to lose 40-60% of your shock troops in any given assault against entrenched Mech Infantry which has been softened up already with either an artillery suicide-charge or stealth-bomber air strikes, so plan accordingly when it comes to your post-conquest goals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the assault is against regular Infantry or Marine, then the loss ratio for shock troops should be in the 20-40% range. The shock troops should NOT be moved after the assault. Leave 2-3 full-strength gunpowder units in place, one of them with medic upgrade, to maximize healing. The only exception is in beachhead assault, where you must put everyone into the city in order to wait out the counter-attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Gunpowder Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Infantry and Mech Infantry are in the same basic category. They are usually considered defensive units, but they are much more versatile than that. There are 3 basic types of Gunpowder units, and your options are going to be complex since you'll likely have legacy units you upgraded. So the unit mix won't be quite as static as armored units, which you can plan from day 1.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Especially valuable are those units who have been promoted from archers and longbowmen because those units can have Drill upgrades, which they keep even as Gunpowder units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shock troops are designated for city assault. These units are essential when facing a city with wall/castle because the 50% bonus can't be reduced with bombardment. Sending anything except for gunpowder units makes the city a meat grinder. Combat I, Pinch, City Assault is the promotion order. Expect 85%+ casualty from units which make the assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Garrison troops are used to hold the captured territory. City Garrison, Combat I, and Medic are the promotion order.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Specialty troops are given Guerilla I and Guerilla II for a special hill-cover unit. , or the Woodman equivalent. For Infantry, in the pre-Gunship era, you may want to get Combat I, Combat II, and Pinch for a specialty anti-tank unit. Once promoted to Mech Inf, you can now fight Modern Armor on equal footing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gunpowder units are needed on a minimum of 1:4 ratio with the armor units in a large-scale assault. If you have 12 armor units (9 shock, 3 cleanup) then expect to carry at least 3 Gunpowder units. If this is the initial landing on enemy territory separated by ocean, the ratio needs to be reversed to 3:1 in favor of gunpowder (12 gunpowder for every 3 armor) in order to weather the initial assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Always keep the Infantry unit's +25% vs gunpowder in mind. Against an infantry unit entrenched in a city guarded by walls, the defender has the 50% bonus in addition to the normal entrenchment. At 100% strength, that gives the defender 35 = 20 (base) + 10 (wall) + 5 (entrench) versus the armor unit's 28. Bad odds. Even if you reduce the infantry defender's base to 60%, it's still 28 vs. 21 (defender).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An assault with an Infantry unit against the same 60% defender, the odds are better at 25 vs. 18 because the wall bonus no longer applies. Even better if the attacker has Pinch and the defender has Garrison because you apply the 25% bonus to a higher base and the defender's bonus is only 20%.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If the defenders are composed of Marines or SAM Infantry, the advantage is even more pronounced. The Marines have a higher base, but the Infantry's 25% bonus makes up the difference. SAM Infantry has a lower base and no gunpowder bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mounted and Helicopter Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the modern era, both you and the AI can have a large number of gunships just because the inventory of cavalry units which was subsequently promoted. In some cases, it's better not to promote because the main use of such mounted units in the modern era is defensive or for pillage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gunship is touted as an anti-armor unit, and there are no good promotion strategy other than Drill. Anything else is useless because it usually doesn't survive combat. The AI is smart enough to cover their tanks with SAM infantry and other gunpowder units, so you'll rarely get a chance to use your gunships against them anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use gunships for raiding. Uniquely, they can move immediately upon unloading from a transport. The initial transoceanic assault will trigger a massive response and gunships will help you survive it by cutting all rail lines around the city you'll be assaulting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use 1 movement to unload, 1 more to get into position, and the remaining 2 to pillage. You need to cut ALL the railroads into the entry city to prevent the 1 MP units from reinforcing. Of course, you should have cut the lines around your initial landing site first.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the initial landing, take the surviving gunpowder units to cover the gunships into proximity any nice geographic features like hills. Create a fire break wherever possible by cutting railroads. Gunships are the only unit which can cut an improved tile in a single turn, although you should plan to sacrifice them. Stalling the enemy counter-attack is well worth doing even if you lose several gunships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you start a war without Gunships, Cavalry is your only option. Once Infantry is in play, Cavalry is useless anyways and their only use is to pillage. If you have any older units left like Horse Archers, etc..., now is the time to use them. You have to use (and lose) twice as many mounted units, but the result will be the same. It's a shame that Explorers can't pillage, because they'd otherwise be the ideal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Important Note:[\BOLD] Due to a bug in the patch, a group (2 more more) of gunships without stack-attack turned on can actually occupy a city. Thus it's actually possible for an all-gunship assault to take enemy territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Siege Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In modern warfare, there is really only 1 siege unit - the artillery. The Machine Gun is worthless and don't even bother bringing it when planning an assault. Its usefulness is strictly against the likes of Cavalry and Rifleman. Once you have infantry, you don't need MG's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The artillery, however, should be your best friend. On an assault, sacrificing 3-4 artillery units is worth it as long as you save a couple of tanks or mech. infantry units from destruction. The slow movement isn't going to matter in your initial beachhead assault, and your operating tempo will slow down to allow units to heal anyways, so you have time to let large artillery divisions move forward. Unlike the catapult or Cannon, the Artillery has enough strength to make a halfway decent defender, and none of the "modern" units have anti-siege bonuses built in. Artillery comes in two varieties - general and assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]General artillery should have Accuracy and Barrage. That makes them suitable both as bombardment if you don't have bombers (or don't want to use them) and as shock troops. The assault artillery is either units built in the West Point city or a general artillery which got promoted enough to get Barrage II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In an assault after all cultural bonus has been worn down, pick your highest Barrage artillery unit and send them in to die. Expect 60-80% mortality rate, and the goal is to wear down the defenders such that you have a definite superiority in attack strength. For every 3 units in the city, expect to use 1 artillery assault. So if a city is defended by 9 units, plan to use at least 3.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A crucial point is that in the initial beachhead assault, you MUST hold at least 4 artillery units in reserve because the AI will inevitably send its most powerful counter-attack immediately. Assuming you brought the right unit mix, the gunships should have cut the roads. That will force the AI to stack up its units instead of just rushing in for the attack. This is where the artillery saves your beachhead by doing so much collateral damage to the stacked up units that you get breathing room to have your transports make another round-trip with reinforcements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval Units[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the convoy system, the only 2 units that matter are Battleship and Transport. You don't need to have carriers, destroyers, etc... unless you seek naval superiority, which really isn't necessary. By the time you are in a modern world war, the health bonus from fish, clam, etc... are no longer critical so the AI is welcome to parade their naval units up and down the coast without interference. If they deny your border cities of the sea-based foods, it's likely that war weariness will reduce your workforce to the point where it doesn't matter anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transports should be given Flanking and Navigation I to bring them up to 6 MP. That puts their range the same as the Battleship, which should receive all the Drill Bonuses possible. You won't need flank or navigation because the BB's aren't going anywhere once they are on station.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In general, you should choose a common embarkation point for transports. Every 6 MP's, station 2 BB's as the convoy guard point. If the ocean is 3 transits wide, you'll need 2 BB stations with a total of 6 units in order to provide relief. All transports, coming and going, will hald on the BB-guarded spots. In general, the AI doesn't like to take on guarded transports without good odds and 2 BB's are long odds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if those are the only places where naval units are found, then the AI will go for them. That's why you should be producing transports for use strictly as bait. Load them up as they are built with a single low-value unit and just send them into the deep blue seas. Losing them keeps the AI navy busy elsewhere while you truck in dozens of new units. To sustain an assault, airlifts alone aren't enough unless you want a grinding war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also remember that the transports have enough attack points that if there is a severely injured BB or destroyer hanging around, feel free to just take him out with an empty transport.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Air Warfare[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most of the strategy articles talk about Stealth Bomber, but that is at the end of the tech tree. Surely people have gone to war while armed strictly with Tanks, Artillery, Infantry, and Bombers?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Industrial Era, the Bomber is of limited utility. It takes at least 6 attacks to reduce a 100% cultural defense down to zero, and that assumes you can obtain a good base. You'll spend a lot of time rebasing bombers, because a base suitable for assaulting one city won't be suitable for another. Given how much the AI likes to use SAM Infantry, the Bomber is in deadly danger as soon as they have Rocketry, which comes a LOT sooner than Stealth Bomber. The Bomber is also relatively worthless in an air strike role unless the enemy AI is so far behind as to NOT have SAM Infantry or Fighters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Prince or above, how likely is it that an AI which you'd have to plan a trans-oceanic assault on doesn't have SAM Infantry?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Bombers are almost a complete waste of time in the city assault role. You'd be better off using the production capacity to produce an artillery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters are also nearly completely worthless.

As long as you rest the Stealth Bombers to heal any time they take damage, you can expect to lose less than 1-in-10 even after 40+ rounds of combat.

By the time you are in a modern world war, the health bonus from fish, clam, etc... are no longer critical so the AI is welcome to parade their naval units up and down the coast without interference. If they deny your border cities of the sea-based foods, it's likely that war weariness will reduce your workforce to the point where it doesn't matter anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transports should be given Flanking and Navigation I to bring them up to 6 MP. That puts their range the same as the Battleship, which should receive all the Drill Bonuses possible. You won't need flank or navigation because the BB's aren't going anywhere once they are on station.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In general, you should choose a common embarkation point for transports. Every 6 MP's, station 2 BB's as the convoy guard point. If the ocean is 3 transits wide, you'll need 2 BB stations with a total of 6 units in order to provide relief. All transports, coming and going, will hald on the BB-guarded spots. In general, the AI doesn't like to take on guarded transports without good odds and 2 BB's are long odds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, if those are the only places where naval units are found, then the AI will go for them. That's why you should be producing transports for use strictly as bait. Load them up as they are built with a single low-value unit and just send them into the deep blue seas. Losing them keeps the AI navy busy elsewhere while you truck in dozens of new units. To sustain an assault, airlifts alone aren't enough unless you want a grinding war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Also remember that the transports have enough attack points that if there is a severely injured BB or destroyer hanging around, feel free to just take him out with an empty transport.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Air Warfare[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most of the strategy articles talk about Stealth Bomber, but that is at the end of the tech tree. Surely people have gone to war while armed strictly with Tanks, Artillery, Infantry, and Bombers?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Industrial Era, the Bomber is of limited utility. It takes at least 6 attacks to reduce a 100% cultural defense down to zero, and that assumes you can obtain a good base. You'll spend a lot of time rebasing bombers, because a base suitable for assaulting one city won't be suitable for another. Given how much the AI likes to use SAM Infantry, the Bomber is in deadly danger as soon as they have Rocketry, which comes a LOT sooner than Stealth Bomber. The Bomber is also relatively worthless in an air strike role unless the enemy AI is so far behind as to NOT have SAM Infantry or Fighters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Prince or above, how likely is it that an AI which you'd have to plan a trans-oceanic assault on doesn't have SAM Infantry?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In short, Bombers are almost a complete waste of time in the city assault role. You'd be better off using the production capacity to produce an artillery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters are also nearly completely worthless. They spend too much time trying to re-base as operations move forward, and the production is better spent on another SAM Infantry or Mech. Infantry unit if you wanted anti-air protection. Unlike fighters, those units are actually useful for something else.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The only air unit even worth building is the Stealth Bomber, which is of course set to be wayyyy too powerful. With a big stack of stealth bombers (12+) not even a city protected by Jet Fighters can reasonable hope to protect it from bombardment. As long as you rest the Stealth Bombers to heal any time they take damage, you can expect to lose less than 1-in-10 even after 40+ rounds of combat. There's no need to discuss how to use these.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H2]Tactics[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some random thoughts, in no particular order[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dealing with Gunships[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sending out any kind of an armor force of Tanks or even Modern Armor without protection is an open invitation for AI gunships to swoop in, and as discussed, the AI always has a lot of gunships since they are upgrades from Cavalry. How to deal with them?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A lot of people like to use SAM Infantry, because of the 50% bonus. Bad idea. Even with the bonus, they don't measure up to the Mech Infantry's attack power. And SAM Infantry can't keep up with tank units. Best to leave these guys back in your conquered cities as air cover.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you don't have the Mech Infantry unit, you should bring along extra Gunships instead. It's a fair fight, and Gunships have little combat role in the city assault anyways since they can't attack an entrenched SAM unit with any kind of success. As part of a stack with tanks, the enemy SAM Infantry can't get at them and you just need to have more Gunships than the enemy can bring the bear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the event there are gunships covering a city, expect to spend a couple more artillery so that your own tanks have a fighting chance at beating them. Infantry against gunship is not a good deal either, and it's better to spend more artillery units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Railroad Raider[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besides the vital necessity of creating a fire-break around your beachhead city, you should have obtained a world map at some point which gives you a look at the terrain. Look for choke points where the road network narrows and plan to drop a transport with a few gunships on that spot. Because of the 4 MP's, a gunship can unload, pillage, and get back on the transport in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any enemy choke point which comes too close to the ocean is your prey. Stay away from squares with towns. Although the plunder is nice, it takes too long to get all the way down to the railroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike previous versions of Civ, you can't cross an entire continent on rails in a single turn. Any degradation of the rail network which causes units to detour is worth doing. A transport loaded with 4 gunships can move down the coast and blow away 2-3 squares worth of railroads in a single turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Feint[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Use the railroad movement cost to your advantage. In Civ4, it's much harder to reinforce. If you have the units, start a false landing with ONLY the crap-units you can't use (machine guns, un-upgraded cannons, old riflemen, unneeded cavalry) in an inaccessible spot near a bad city. The AI will respond in force regardless, and it'll draw all those 1 MP units too far from your actual beachhead to respond the same turn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That extra turn gives you the breathing space make sure you cut rail links. This tactic is best combined with Railroad Raider. If you draw them out and then cut the roads behind them, you can comfortably settle in before they reach you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Research Priority[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Considering the relative useless nature of bombers, is it really necessary to research Radio early on?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead of 6k on Radio, get Rocketry first because Gunships are a lot more valuable.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]On the Finer Points of Tank Warfare[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]cleverhandle[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I love Tanks. And while I know that the diehard warmongers would consider a game that lasts long enough to see them a disgrace, I'd still like to share some thoughts about how to make the most of these lovely, rolling implements of destruction. Experienced warmongers may view much of this as obvious implications of the combat system, but hopefully there will be a few tips useful for everyone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Significance:[\BOLD] The combination of two moves, collateral damage, and city raider allow one to capture enemy cities far more quickly than in previous eras. Conquering a city every other turn with only a modest battlegroup (i.e. 10 to 12 tanks) is easily possible, given the right tactics. This can have tremendous impact, whether you're a builder looking to demolish a rival or a warmonger looking for an early end date.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Objective:[\BOLD] Conquer enemy cities as [BOLD]quickly[\BOLD] as possible. At this stage of the game, IMO, losing an occasional tank is well worth cutting your conquest time by 50% to 75%. The war weariness, supply costs, and wasted turns before victory are more important than a few hundred hammers. If you are significantly behind your enemy and are trying for a desperate late game power-grab, these tactics may not be appropriate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Assumptions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) You are at least close to tech/power parity with your victim. It's fine if he has gunships and/or SAM's. If he's far enough ahead to already have Jets or MechInfs, then you're probably too late.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) You have Flight and Radio (for Fighters and Bombers). Having Rocketry (for Gunships) and Robotics (for MechInfs) is nice, but by no means required. You also need Airports in your major military production cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) You have a reasonable supply of Level 4 (10XP) units. Just having a military city with West Point is enough - you don't need a ton of Level 4 units. Having the Pentagon and civics such that every city can produce 10XP troops is obviously nice, but again not strictly necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) You're playing on Settler. Kidding... this works fine at least through Emperor, provided you can stay in the game well enough to meet the other criteria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]What you need:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tanks: Well, duh. More specifically, you need several kinds:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Raider Tanks - your heavy hitters: You want 3 of these, 4 is better. These are the ones that really need to be Level 4 to be effective. Take Raider I, Raider II, and Barrage I promotions. Take Raider III at Level 5 if you get there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Drill Tanks - cleanup crew: How many you need depends on how many troops you're up against. A number equal to the number of defending troops is safe. If you're in a time/production bind, you can reasonably count on blitzing for multiple attacks but make sure that the target city isn't on a hill (costs 2 moves to attack). Promote these with as many Drill promos as you can get.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Cover Tanks - protection: You want 2 or 3 of these, depending on how much you fear the enemy's counterattack. Promote either all Combat or Combat I/II, Ambush depending on whether you think a counterattack will be heavier on tanks or artillery/gunships. If you have Gunships, one of them can replace one of these. If you have MechInfs, use them instead. On the very first assault of a war, these will take a larger beating as the AI throws its extra troops at them. For the fastest conquest, keep two extras safe behind your lines and ready to move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Non-Tank units:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Medics - Explorers are essential for this, because they'll likely be the only available 2 move unit that can take medic. You need two of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Bombers - The more the merrier, but 10 is probably enough. 15 can cut through even the toughest air defenses I've seen. More than that is overkill. Expect to lose about one for every other city and be ready to replace them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Fighters - Two or three flying Interception within range of the target city. Only needed if the victim has Bombers himself, in order to intercept bombing runs against your approaching stack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Worker pair w/cover - Very important. You need to be able to quickly build rails in conquered territory. In contrast to Civ3, the AI doesn't appear to be very keen on snagging covered workers. I tend to cover with only a single tough defender like a Combat I/II/Ambush Infantry. An extra cover unit would be safer. Having two pairs of workers is also nice, but not essential.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]How it works:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In most situations, this will be a two turn process - one to approach and the other to attack. If terrain, culture, or a reliance on blitz necessitate an extra approach turn, you may want to hold off some or all of the bombers until turn two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Turn 1:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Tank group approaches. Since tanks don't receive terrain bonuses, you generally just want the fastest path. But sometimes you can position yourself so that incoming attacks are across a river, which is helpful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) First bombing run - balance is key here. It's important to damage the units in the target city on this turn since the combat system significantly penalizes weakened attackers. You want counterattacking tanks, artillery, and gunships to come at you at no more than 75% strength or so. At the same time, your airstrikes won't be effective until you've lowered the culture defense, and of course you need to start softening them up for your approaching tanks anyway. Keep in mind that, at 15%/turn, it takes 7 successful bombing runs to completely eliminate enemy defenses. I tend to go about 60/40 %bombard vs. unit bombard on this turn. %bombard first, then unit bombard. If you have a surplus of air power, it's worth looking around at other cities near your target in order to weaken any responders there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Turn 2:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Second bombing run - Finish what the first one started. You should really have enough bombers to both zero out the cultural defense and reduce all defenders to 50%. If that's impossible, go for a balanced approach. If the enemy has bunkers (which is pretty rare, in my experience), try to make sure that every unit takes a few hits but don't get hung up on it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Raiders attack - This wave has two objectives - take out the toughest defenders and soften up the remainder for your drill tanks. These tanks [BOLD]will[\BOLD] take damage, though hopefully not be destroyed. Do [BOLD]not[\BOLD] use every raider tank you brought. Two is enough - the goal is speed, and the more damage you suffer the more time you spend healing. After two collateral damage hits from these the rest of the defenders should be under 50% strength, and it's time to move on. The third/fourth raider tanks are purely for backup purposes in case the other two get badly beat up by counterstrikes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Drill tanks attack - This wave takes advantage of first strikes, letting your drill tanks sweep up defenders with a good probability of taking no damage. Nothing elaborate, just send them in. Don't blitz with a wounded tank unless absolutely required - not because you'll lose it, but because you want to minimize healing time. This wave should capture the city. If you've never tried this, expect to be surprised at how your tanks can go 5 for 5 battles or more without taking a scratch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Move in to the city? - This gets tricky, depending on how the enemy countered your advance. If you have damaged tanks (from an artillery or air strike, perhaps) that haven't moved, you may want to leave them outside the city to get an extra turn of healing. Just make sure they're protected by one of your cover units, and keep one of the medics there of course. The AI doesn't seem terribly interested in picking off your stack provided that it's covered. Otherwise, move them in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Fly in a garrison - You do have a garrison infantry waiting at a friendly airport, right? Your shiny new city can accept one airlifted unit each turn, even while it's revolting. Make sure you have another one for next turn, too. If you want a larger garrison, you can airlift to the nearest city and move it over via rails.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The result:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You have a new city and a bunch of tanks that need, at most, a single skipped turn to heal. After you've weathered the initial counterstrikes in a war, it's entirely common that only your lead raider tank takes any damage at all - let that one stay behind to heal up, and the others can start their next approach on the turn after the first assault. Typical losses are 1-2 tanks and 3-4 bombers for a sustained campaign taking 6-8 cities from an enemy of roughly equal power. If your unfortunate victim doesn't have any far-flung island cities, a tank campaign along these lines can eliminate an enemy civ in under 20 turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I think that's pretty much it. I hope these tactics prove useful in your conquests. Comments, questions, and improvements are welcomed.</English>

You should really have enough bombers to both zero out the cultural defense and reduce all defenders to 50%. If that's impossible, go for a balanced approach. If the enemy has bunkers (which is pretty rare, in my experience), try to make sure that every unit takes a few hits but don't get hung up on it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Raiders attack - This wave has two objectives - take out the toughest defenders and soften up the remainder for your drill tanks. These tanks [BOLD]will[\BOLD] take damage, though hopefully not be destroyed. Do [BOLD]not[\BOLD] use every raider tank you brought. Two is enough - the goal is speed, and the more damage you suffer the more time you spend healing. After two collateral damage hits from these the rest of the defenders should be under 50% strength, and it's time to move on. The third/fourth raider tanks are purely for backup purposes in case the other two get badly beat up by counterstrikes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Drill tanks attack - This wave takes advantage of first strikes, letting your drill tanks sweep up defenders with a good probability of taking no damage. Nothing elaborate, just send them in. Don't blitz with a wounded tank unless absolutely required - not because you'll lose it, but because you want to minimize healing time. This wave should capture the city. If you've never tried this, expect to be surprised at how your tanks can go 5 for 5 battles or more without taking a scratch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Move in to the city? - This gets tricky, depending on how the enemy countered your advance. If you have damaged tanks (from an artillery or air strike, perhaps) that haven't moved, you may want to leave them outside the city to get an extra turn of healing. Just make sure they're protected by one of your cover units, and keep one of the medics there of course. The AI doesn't seem terribly interested in picking off your stack provided that it's covered. Otherwise, move them in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5) Fly in a garrison - You do have a garrison infantry waiting at a friendly airport, right? Your shiny new city can accept one airlifted unit each turn, even while it's revolting. Make sure you have another one for next turn, too. If you want a larger garrison, you can airlift to the nearest city and move it over via rails.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The result:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You have a new city and a bunch of tanks that need, at most, a single skipped turn to heal. After you've weathered the initial counterstrikes in a war, it's entirely common that only your lead raider tank takes any damage at all - let that one stay behind to heal up, and the others can start their next approach on the turn after the first assault. Typical losses are 1-2 tanks and 3-4 bombers for a sustained campaign taking 6-8 cities from an enemy of roughly equal power. If your unfortunate victim doesn't have any far-flung island cities, a tank campaign along these lines can eliminate an enemy civ in under 20 turns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I think that's pretty much it. I hope these tactics prove useful in your conquests. Comments, questions, and improvements are welcomed.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]On the Finer Points of Tank Warfare[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]cleverhandle[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I love Tanks. And while I know that the diehard warmongers would consider a game that lasts long enough to see them a disgrace, I'd still like to share some thoughts about how to make the most of these lovely, rolling implements of destruction. Experienced warmongers may view much of this as obvious implications of the combat system, but hopefully there will be a few tips useful for everyone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Significance:[\BOLD] The combination of two moves, collateral damage, and city raider allow one to capture enemy cities far more quickly than in previous eras. Conquering a city every other turn with only a modest battlegroup (i.e. 10 to 12 tanks) is easily possible, given the right tactics. This can have tremendous impact, whether you're a builder looking to demolish a rival or a warmonger looking for an early end date.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Objective:[\BOLD] Conquer enemy cities as [BOLD]quickly[\BOLD] as possible. At this stage of the game, IMO, losing an occasional tank is well worth cutting your conquest time by 50% to 75%. The war weariness, supply costs, and wasted turns before victory are more important than a few hundred hammers. If you are significantly behind your enemy and are trying for a desperate late game power-grab, these tactics may not be appropriate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Assumptions:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) You are at least close to tech/power parity with your victim. It's fine if he has gunships and/or SAM's. If he's far enough ahead to already have Jets or MechInfs, then you're probably too late.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) You have Flight and Radio (for Fighters and Bombers). Having Rocketry (for Gunships) and Robotics (for MechInfs) is nice, but by no means required. You also need Airports in your major military production cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) You have a reasonable supply of Level 4 (10XP) units. Just having a military city with West Point is enough - you don't need a ton of Level 4 units. Having the Pentagon and civics such that every city can produce 10XP troops is obviously nice, but again not strictly necessary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) You're playing on Settler. Kidding... this works fine at least through Emperor, provided you can stay in the game well enough to meet the other criteria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]What you need:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tanks: Well, duh. More specifically, you need several kinds:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Raider Tanks - your heavy hitters: You want 3 of these, 4 is better. These are the ones that really need to be Level 4 to be effective. Take Raider I, Raider II, and Barrage I promotions. Take Raider III at Level 5 if you get there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Drill Tanks - cleanup crew: How many you need depends on how many troops you're up against. A number equal to the number of defending troops is safe. If you're in a time/production bind, you can reasonably count on blitzing for multiple attacks but make sure that the target city isn't on a hill (costs 2 moves to attack). Promote these with as many Drill promos as you can get.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Cover Tanks - protection: You want 2 or 3 of these, depending on how much you fear the enemy's counterattack. Promote either all Combat or Combat I/II, Ambush depending on whether you think a counterattack will be heavier on tanks or artillery/gunships. If you have Gunships, one of them can replace one of these. If you have MechInfs, use them instead. On the very first assault of a war, these will take a larger beating as the AI throws its extra troops at them. For the fastest conquest, keep two extras safe behind your lines and ready to move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Non-Tank units:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Medics - Explorers are essential for this, because they'll likely be the only available 2 move unit that can take medic. You need two of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) Bombers - The more the merrier, but 10 is probably enough. 15 can cut through even the toughest air defenses I've seen. More than that is overkill. Expect to lose about one for every other city and be ready to replace them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3) Fighters - Two or three flying Interception within range of the target city. Only needed if the victim has Bombers himself, in order to intercept bombing runs against your approaching stack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4) Worker pair w/cover - Very important. You need to be able to quickly build rails in conquered territory. In contrast to Civ3, the AI doesn't appear to be very keen on snagging covered workers. I tend to cover with only a single tough defender like a Combat I/II/Ambush Infantry. An extra cover unit would be safer. Having two pairs of workers is also nice, but not essential.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]How it works:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In most situations, this will be a two turn process - one to approach and the other to attack. If terrain, culture, or a reliance on blitz necessitate an extra approach turn, you may want to hold off some or all of the bombers until turn two.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Turn 1:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Tank group approaches. Since tanks don't receive terrain bonuses, you generally just want the fastest path. But sometimes you can position yourself so that incoming attacks are across a river, which is helpful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2) First bombing run - balance is key here. It's important to damage the units in the target city on this turn since the combat system significantly penalizes weakened attackers. You want counterattacking tanks, artillery, and gunships to come at you at no more than 75% strength or so. At the same time, your airstrikes won't be effective until you've lowered the culture defense, and of course you need to start softening them up for your approaching tanks anyway. Keep in mind that, at 15%/turn, it takes 7 successful bombing runs to completely eliminate enemy defenses. I tend to go about 60/40 %bombard vs. unit bombard on this turn. %bombard first, then unit bombard. If you have a surplus of air power, it's worth looking around at other cities near your target in order to weaken any responders there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Turn 2:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1) Second bombing run - Finish what the first one started. You should really have enough bombers to both zero out the cultural defense and reduce all defenders to 50%. If that's impossible, go for a balanced approach.

		<English>[H1]Modern Naval Strategy for Beyond the Sword[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond the Sword changed many things about the game, and naval warfare was one of the most dramatically affected. The limits on aircraft units per city changed the scope, but not the basis of air warfare. The additional units in land warfare made siege units relevant again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But war at sea was completely changed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the vanilla CIV4, naval supremacy was nice to have but not necessary. The worst that could happen from not owning the oceans was losing some fishing boats and an air strike here and there (which you could counter with land-based aircraft). After your massed stealth bombers whittle them down, a few battleships can take down entire fleets of weakened enemy ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cruise missiles and tactical nukes changed all that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, not having sea superiority means that large stretches of your interior can be devastated, and possibly even nuked. The AI also uses amphibious assaults more often, and in conjunction with missle/nuke strikes. At the same time, the equation for gaining sea power has gotten more complicated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A whole new naval strategy is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To start, let's cover the main units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Missile Cruiser[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is going to be your main combatant. Once onboard missles are exhausted, this is just a battleship and should be used accordingly. Promotions should be for Drill 1, Drill 2, and then Barrage. The idea is that you want the MC to survive initial combat, and then start prepping the rest of the enemy fleet for destruction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You shouldn't feel the need to always have fully-loaded MC's, but rather keep a few empties around so that they can fight the battles. Once the enemy is down to ~27 strength, a Drill 2 MC should be sent in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a protracted war at sea, expect to build (and lose) a lot of MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Stealth Destroyer[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a misunderstood unit in because it's NOT a replacement for the destroyer the way a MC is a replacement for Battleship in every way. This is a brand new unit, like the Attack Submarine, and needs to be used in a brand new way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two basic role exists for Stealth Destroyers - surveillance and assassin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the surveillance role, the SD should have Flanking and Sentry to maximize the viewing radius. Surveillance SD's (S-SD) should be deployed to make EVERY ocean square between you and your enemy visible. There can be no fog of war when it comes to naval warfare unless you want an entire fleet to sneak up on you. The specifics of how such a picket line should be ployed will be discussed later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another use for the S-SD's is to sneak in and bombard enemy cities' cultural defenses, if your picket lines are close enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assassin role, the SD should have only Drill promotions, and hold those promotions in reserve for healing injuries. Once you kill opposing SD's, your highly damaged SD's can be in the middle of the ocean but also be perfectly safe. That's why your Assassin SD's (A-SD) should be the vehicle of choice for finishing off damaged units or hunting down tranports/subs/carriers. They're the only ones who can survive the aftermath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]SD's should emphatically NOT be employed in a stack with other units, the way the AI does. It doesn't buy you anything, since SD's won't defend against anything except another SD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a critical unit, because the AI really loves to use submarines to deliver tactical nukes. Once you have Stealth Destroyers, you'll need Attack Subs in order to help locate and destroy enemy submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because Attack Subs should only be used against other subs or transports/carriers or heavily damaged units, it's in the same category as a S-SD and should get Flanking and Sentry. Additional promotions should be Navigation 1 and 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is also a crucial unit because it's the way to deliver tactical nukes and additional cruise missles to a front-deployed fleet. There's no combat role for the submarine because it's not powerful enough to fight any of the late-game opponents head on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want missle strikes - better to deliver it from a MC, which can follow up with an attack or survive a counter-attack after getting close to enemy shores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want to detect/kill other subs, the Attack Sub is much better.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why the main role of subs is to either shuttle cruise missles to re-load MC's which have fired their on-board supply or to sneak in a tactical nuke. As such, submarines receive Flanking and Navigation 1/2. Beyond that, add Sentry to help avoid threats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Battleship[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whatever battleships you have as of the time that MC's come along - leave them alone. There's no need to spend money upgrading BB's when they don't gain any combat power and the supply of cruise missiles always tend to trail the number of MC's on hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use the BB's for the same role as they had in CIV4 original - escorting carriers and transports. Their MP's are perfect, once the transport/carrier has been upgraded with Navigation 1. They're just as powerful in defensive role as MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's no particular need to stock up on BB's, and also no reason to change how you use them from the original CIV4. You can't see SD's or subs sneaking up on you, but that's why you have surveillance SD's and Attack Subs anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Destroyers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are critical units which should be stockpiled in large numbers. Build them while you can and NEVER upgrade them. You can always build more SD's, but the supply of destroyers you have are finite[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's have the ability to detect subs, they can move farther than the Attack Subs, and can kill the invading subs just as effectively. On top of that, they still retain their anti-air capabilities, so they're not nearly as vulnerable to air assault as the submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's also come in the same 2 varieties as SD's - surveillance or attack. Unlike SD's, surveillance-type DD's should be used to escort large fleets because it'll provide some redundant sub-spotting (and killing) capability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otherwise, attack- and surveillance-DD's should be deployed near shorelines because they're so valuable and so vulnerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carriers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In theory, carriers are much less useful than before. Air recon can't detect submarines or Stealth Destroyers, and the naval strike role which made Jet fighters valuable can now be taken over by missiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, carriers are still useful for providing first-strike on detected submarines and MC's which have been stripped of their escorts. More importantly, they have a HUGE role in one of the main purposes of the navy - supporting a beachhead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Technically not an unit, but so crucial it deserves its own mention. With BTS, fortifications act as cities for naval and air purposes. That means new tricks which were impossible before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A naval unit can use a fort to create a land-bridge to cross an island while an enemy fleet must take the long way around. A ship can move from ocean-to-fort #1, then fort #1-to-city, then city-to-fort #2, and finally fort #2 to ocean. A crossing which might have used on the entire MP quota of a MC could instead be completed with only 4 MP's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ocean-Fort-City-Fort-Ocean[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can also be constructed to give you secure naval bases in stretches of your territory where it makes no sense to plant a city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can be used to house fighters/bombers to help support your coastal defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you're lucky enough to have an island off your shore, build a city on it just to be able to use it as forward air/naval station. Forts give you shortcuts to help chase down a faster enemy, and a secure way of bringing your transports further along before exposing them to attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval deployments[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several major categories of naval war strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can choose to fight a defensive action, where your fleets are deployed out of home ports and are tasked with killing any unit you see. The goal is to protect your own lands while the land war continues or you're trying to prevent a landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's also the offensive approach, where you bring your fleets near the enemy cities to offer battle and to strike at their infrastructure. The goal is to decimate their coastal cities and wipe out their fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, there's the sea-lane action where the goal is to maintain a secure travel route in order to ship in more units for the war in a distant location.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, a large war will always involve at least some of each of the 3 in different phases. It might start with a defensive action, then you'd move to secure a sea lane to provide an invasion corridor, and finally shift over to a total offensive action.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or it might be the other way around, where you deploy your fleet to a forward position to nail the initial stack-of-doom invasion fleet and then pull back to a defensive position shortly afterwards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In all cases, there are some basic tactics to consider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Oceanic Surveillance[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Stealth Destroyer, it's critical that you cover the ocean with your own Surveillance-SD's. Each S-SD can cover 14 ocean squares, so it doesn't take that many units. Because enemy SD's can easily move beyond the range of your S-SD in a single turn, you need to either deploy enough units to cover the ENTIRE ocean or establish two picket lines far enough apart that there's no way that an enemy unit can get past your S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Between the S-SD pickets, you should seed in Attack Subs, also spaced out carefully to make sure there are no gaps. That's the only way you're going to spot the enemy subs given the disability of the S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination, the line should look like[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](enemy continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](home continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE][NEWLINE](each [COLOR_RED]+[COLOR_REVERT] and [COLOR_RED]-[COLOR_REVERT] represents an empty ocean square)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The combined 9 spaces between the SD lines means that it's impossible for enemy SD's to slip by, and the double-line of attack subs also ensure that no submarine can make it past without being stuck in at least 1 location where your own Attack Submarine can see it. The absence of an Attack Sub is also a clue that there must be at least 1 enemy sub in the vicinity, so units in the 1st line should be prepared to move up to the next line at any time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The goal is to NOT use the units in the line to make attacks and to place your own battle fleet in a position to attack only after detection of the enemy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack echelon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When attacking an enemy fleet, always check if there's SD's in the stack. If there is, send your own attack-configured Stealth Destroyers in first to engage them. Beyond that, use cruise missiles to soften up the enemy units to around 30 strength, and then send in your highest promoted MC which has Barrage. That MC will probably die, but naval warfare is about attrition - not experience. It'll soften up the fleet for follow up attacks. Then send in additional MC's until there are no units above strength ~20.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, it's time for the assassin SD's to enter the fray and clean up. By holding back promotions, the same group of SD's can be used to attack multiple fleets over time and they're perfectly safe sitting in the middle of the ocean as long as you eliminate enemy SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts and airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Airpower is less powerful now that nearly 1/2 of the modern AI navy can't be detected by recon, but that's why you deployed that Oceanic Surveillance network. Forts give you places to put Stealth Bombers where it can do the most good, and add to the numbers of deployed aircraft. Do NOT send in stealth bombers until the enemy jet fighters are eliminated, but they can be deadly against subs and missile cruisers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each fort should come standard with at least 1 A-SD and 1 S-DD, to provide full coastal surveillance. Then drop in a gunpowder unit with Medic to provide healing and cover against amphib assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carrier airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given the danger of parking a carrier in the middle of the ocean, and how softening up the enemy fleet can be done via cruise missiles - there isn't much of a role for carriers as before. Their job is now more specialized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carriers should also be based in forts/frontier port cities. They can sally out 4 squares, launch air strikes, and then retreat. Rather than trying to avoid the enemy fighters, you're going AFTER them. Strike directly at the enemy carriers, and whittle down their fighters to open them up for stealth bomber strikes. That covers everything between line #1 and #2 on your surveillance net.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can then reload with fighters from a secure home port during the same turn, and be ready to sally forth again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assault role, carriers are a lifesaver. When an enemy city is taken, it's never taken with the airport intact so the amount of airpower available is limited. There's also no option to use nearby cities to provide extra air cover if this is the beachhead. Support the ocean crossing with carriers, and you can park as many fighters in the conquered city as you want. Then every available slot can be used for Stealth Bombers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine shuttle[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unless you plan to use tactical nukes, regular submarines are mainly useful in finding other subs and bringing cruise missiles to bear. Like regular land units in transports, missiles can be transferred from subs to MC's. That will help fleets to keep a full inventory of cruise missles without coming off their forward-deployed stations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the surveillance pickets are keeping an eye open for any intruding units, the submarine carrying missiles to the front should have a secure journey, doubly so if the MC move back enough spaces to shorten the journey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Convoy Escort[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When escorting convoys, you need a BIG fleet unless your sea superiority is so complete that the AI navy is completely decimated. But given production advantages, that's unlikely. In general, a convoy's escorting fleet units should reflect how many turns the fleet will be in transit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MC's = (# turns) x3[NEWLINE]SD's = (# turns) x2[NEWLINE]DD's = (# turns) x1[NEWLINE]Carriers = 3 minimum[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's a lot of ships but you should need 1 escort fleet per ocean and you can use it to escort 4 or 25 transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I consider the "typical" crossing to be 3 turns, landing the army on the 3rd turn. That means a fleet of 9 MC's, 6 SD's, 3 DD's and 3 carriers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of the turn, move the carriers forward 2 spaces and send out 2 fighters to recon for large fleets. That will make sure you detect any large stacks of BB's or MC's for a detour if necessary. Next, send the DD's on a roundabout route to the targeted rendevous point. With S-DD's, you should be able to scan a 6-square wide corridor and still get the DD's to the target point. Any detected subs will be struck by air power. SD's with cruise missiles and subs with air strikes. Move your A-SD's in for the kill and then have them rejoin the fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the final move of the turn, the rest of the fleet (MC, carrier, and transports) will move to the convoy station through a thoroughly sanitized area so that the AI won't know for sure you have transports coming their way. Remember that the AI's LOVE Espionage so they already know your port of embarkation. They just don't know when the transports will sail. But they will know once your transports leave port, so it's important to deny the AI precise location on your transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Final point - the transports should hold off-shore the planned insertion point as far as possible on the final move to keep out of range of land-based air and units which might sally forth from secure ports. That means even if you have the MP's to gt within 4 squares of the coast on that turn, hold off 6-7 squares so that the transport can make a last-turn dash straight for the enemy coast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Coastline defense[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With cruise missiles, stealth destroyers, and air strikes - defending off-shore platforms and fishing boats are just a quick way to get your units killed. Stockpile the work boats and leave those resources unguarded. A good surveillance network will protect your off-shre resources more surely than a bunch of sentry-duty MC's or SD's.</English>
		<French>[H1]Modern Naval Strategy for Beyond the Sword[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond the Sword changed many things about the game, and naval warfare was one of the most dramatically affected. The limits on aircraft units per city changed the scope, but not the basis of air warfare. The additional units in land warfare made siege units relevant again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But war at sea was completely changed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the vanilla CIV4, naval supremacy was nice to have but not necessary. The worst that could happen from not owning the oceans was losing some fishing boats and an air strike here and there (which you could counter with land-based aircraft). After your massed stealth bombers whittle them down, a few battleships can take down entire fleets of weakened enemy ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cruise missiles and tactical nukes changed all that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, not having sea superiority means that large stretches of your interior can be devastated, and possibly even nuked. The AI also uses amphibious assaults more often, and in conjunction with missle/nuke strikes. At the same time, the equation for gaining sea power has gotten more complicated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A whole new naval strategy is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To start, let's cover the main units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Missile Cruiser[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is going to be your main combatant. Once onboard missles are exhausted, this is just a battleship and should be used accordingly. Promotions should be for Drill 1, Drill 2, and then Barrage. The idea is that you want the MC to survive initial combat, and then start prepping the rest of the enemy fleet for destruction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You shouldn't feel the need to always have fully-loaded MC's, but rather keep a few empties around so that they can fight the battles. Once the enemy is down to ~27 strength, a Drill 2 MC should be sent in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a protracted war at sea, expect to build (and lose) a lot of MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Stealth Destroyer[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a misunderstood unit in because it's NOT a replacement for the destroyer the way a MC is a replacement for Battleship in every way. This is a brand new unit, like the Attack Submarine, and needs to be used in a brand new way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two basic role exists for Stealth Destroyers - surveillance and assassin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the surveillance role, the SD should have Flanking and Sentry to maximize the viewing radius. Surveillance SD's (S-SD) should be deployed to make EVERY ocean square between you and your enemy visible. There can be no fog of war when it comes to naval warfare unless you want an entire fleet to sneak up on you. The specifics of how such a picket line should be ployed will be discussed later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another use for the S-SD's is to sneak in and bombard enemy cities' cultural defenses, if your picket lines are close enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assassin role, the SD should have only Drill promotions, and hold those promotions in reserve for healing injuries. Once you kill opposing SD's, your highly damaged SD's can be in the middle of the ocean but also be perfectly safe. That's why your Assassin SD's (A-SD) should be the vehicle of choice for finishing off damaged units or hunting down tranports/subs/carriers. They're the only ones who can survive the aftermath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]SD's should emphatically NOT be employed in a stack with other units, the way the AI does. It doesn't buy you anything, since SD's won't defend against anything except another SD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a critical unit, because the AI really loves to use submarines to deliver tactical nukes. Once you have Stealth Destroyers, you'll need Attack Subs in order to help locate and destroy enemy submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because Attack Subs should only be used against other subs or transports/carriers or heavily damaged units, it's in the same category as a S-SD and should get Flanking and Sentry. Additional promotions should be Navigation 1 and 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is also a crucial unit because it's the way to deliver tactical nukes and additional cruise missles to a front-deployed fleet. There's no combat role for the submarine because it's not powerful enough to fight any of the late-game opponents head on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want missle strikes - better to deliver it from a MC, which can follow up with an attack or survive a counter-attack after getting close to enemy shores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want to detect/kill other subs, the Attack Sub is much better.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why the main role of subs is to either shuttle cruise missles to re-load MC's which have fired their on-board supply or to sneak in a tactical nuke. As such, submarines receive Flanking and Navigation 1/2. Beyond that, add Sentry to help avoid threats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Battleship[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whatever battleships you have as of the time that MC's come along - leave them alone. There's no need to spend money upgrading BB's when they don't gain any combat power and the supply of cruise missiles always tend to trail the number of MC's on hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use the BB's for the same role as they had in CIV4 original - escorting carriers and transports. Their MP's are perfect, once the transport/carrier has been upgraded with Navigation 1. They're just as powerful in defensive role as MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's no particular need to stock up on BB's, and also no reason to change how you use them from the original CIV4. You can't see SD's or subs sneaking up on you, but that's why you have surveillance SD's and Attack Subs anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Destroyers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are critical units which should be stockpiled in large numbers. Build them while you can and NEVER upgrade them. You can always build more SD's, but the supply of destroyers you have are finite[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's have the ability to detect subs, they can move farther than the Attack Subs, and can kill the invading subs just as effectively. On top of that, they still retain their anti-air capabilities, so they're not nearly as vulnerable to air assault as the submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's also come in the same 2 varieties as SD's - surveillance or attack. Unlike SD's, surveillance-type DD's should be used to escort large fleets because it'll provide some redundant sub-spotting (and killing) capability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otherwise, attack- and surveillance-DD's should be deployed near shorelines because they're so valuable and so vulnerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carriers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In theory, carriers are much less useful than before. Air recon can't detect submarines or Stealth Destroyers, and the naval strike role which made Jet fighters valuable can now be taken over by missiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, carriers are still useful for providing first-strike on detected submarines and MC's which have been stripped of their escorts. More importantly, they have a HUGE role in one of the main purposes of the navy - supporting a beachhead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Technically not an unit, but so crucial it deserves its own mention. With BTS, fortifications act as cities for naval and air purposes. That means new tricks which were impossible before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A naval unit can use a fort to create a land-bridge to cross an island while an enemy fleet must take the long way around. A ship can move from ocean-to-fort #1, then fort #1-to-city, then city-to-fort #2, and finally fort #2 to ocean. A crossing which might have used on the entire MP quota of a MC could instead be completed with only 4 MP's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ocean-Fort-City-Fort-Ocean[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can also be constructed to give you secure naval bases in stretches of your territory where it makes no sense to plant a city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can be used to house fighters/bombers to help support your coastal defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you're lucky enough to have an island off your shore, build a city on it just to be able to use it as forward air/naval station. Forts give you shortcuts to help chase down a faster enemy, and a secure way of bringing your transports further along before exposing them to attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval deployments[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several major categories of naval war strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can choose to fight a defensive action, where your fleets are deployed out of home ports and are tasked with killing any unit you see. The goal is to protect your own lands while the land war continues or you're trying to prevent a landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's also the offensive approach, where you bring your fleets near the enemy cities to offer battle and to strike at their infrastructure. The goal is to decimate their coastal cities and wipe out their fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, there's the sea-lane action where the goal is to maintain a secure travel route in order to ship in more units for the war in a distant location.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, a large war will always involve at least some of each of the 3 in different phases. It might start with a defensive action, then you'd move to secure a sea lane to provide an invasion corridor, and finally shift over to a total offensive action.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or it might be the other way around, where you deploy your fleet to a forward position to nail the initial stack-of-doom invasion fleet and then pull back to a defensive position shortly afterwards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In all cases, there are some basic tactics to consider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Oceanic Surveillance[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Stealth Destroyer, it's critical that you cover the ocean with your own Surveillance-SD's. Each S-SD can cover 14 ocean squares, so it doesn't take that many units. Because enemy SD's can easily move beyond the range of your S-SD in a single turn, you need to either deploy enough units to cover the ENTIRE ocean or establish two picket lines far enough apart that there's no way that an enemy unit can get past your S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Between the S-SD pickets, you should seed in Attack Subs, also spaced out carefully to make sure there are no gaps. That's the only way you're going to spot the enemy subs given the disability of the S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination, the line should look like[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](enemy continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](home continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE][NEWLINE](each [COLOR_RED]+[COLOR_REVERT] and [COLOR_RED]-[COLOR_REVERT] represents an empty ocean square)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The combined 9 spaces between the SD lines means that it's impossible for enemy SD's to slip by, and the double-line of attack subs also ensure that no submarine can make it past without being stuck in at least 1 location where your own Attack Submarine can see it. The absence of an Attack Sub is also a clue that there must be at least 1 enemy sub in the vicinity, so units in the 1st line should be prepared to move up to the next line at any time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The goal is to NOT use the units in the line to make attacks and to place your own battle fleet in a position to attack only after detection of the enemy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack echelon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When attacking an enemy fleet, always check if there's SD's in the stack.

That MC will probably die, but naval warfare is about attrition - not experience. It'll soften up the fleet for follow up attacks. Then send in additional MC's until there are no units above strength ~20.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, it's time for the assassin SD's to enter the fray and clean up.

Unlike SD's, surveillance-type DD's should be used to escort large fleets because it'll provide some redundant sub-spotting (and killing) capability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otherwise, attack- and surveillance-DD's should be deployed near shorelines because they're so valuable and so vulnerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carriers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In theory, carriers are much less useful than before. Air recon can't detect submarines or Stealth Destroyers, and the naval strike role which made Jet fighters valuable can now be taken over by missiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, carriers are still useful for providing first-strike on detected submarines and MC's which have been stripped of their escorts. More importantly, they have a HUGE role in one of the main purposes of the navy - supporting a beachhead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Technically not an unit, but so crucial it deserves its own mention. With BTS, fortifications act as cities for naval and air purposes. That means new tricks which were impossible before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A naval unit can use a fort to create a land-bridge to cross an island while an enemy fleet must take the long way around. A ship can move from ocean-to-fort #1, then fort #1-to-city, then city-to-fort #2, and finally fort #2 to ocean. A crossing which might have used on the entire MP quota of a MC could instead be completed with only 4 MP's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ocean-Fort-City-Fort-Ocean[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can also be constructed to give you secure naval bases in stretches of your territory where it makes no sense to plant a city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can be used to house fighters/bombers to help support your coastal defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you're lucky enough to have an island off your shore, build a city on it just to be able to use it as forward air/naval station. Forts give you shortcuts to help chase down a faster enemy, and a secure way of bringing your transports further along before exposing them to attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval deployments[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several major categories of naval war strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can choose to fight a defensive action, where your fleets are deployed out of home ports and are tasked with killing any unit you see. The goal is to protect your own lands while the land war continues or you're trying to prevent a landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's also the offensive approach, where you bring your fleets near the enemy cities to offer battle and to strike at their infrastructure. The goal is to decimate their coastal cities and wipe out their fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, there's the sea-lane action where the goal is to maintain a secure travel route in order to ship in more units for the war in a distant location.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, a large war will always involve at least some of each of the 3 in different phases. It might start with a defensive action, then you'd move to secure a sea lane to provide an invasion corridor, and finally shift over to a total offensive action.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or it might be the other way around, where you deploy your fleet to a forward position to nail the initial stack-of-doom invasion fleet and then pull back to a defensive position shortly afterwards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In all cases, there are some basic tactics to consider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Oceanic Surveillance[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Stealth Destroyer, it's critical that you cover the ocean with your own Surveillance-SD's. Each S-SD can cover 14 ocean squares, so it doesn't take that many units. Because enemy SD's can easily move beyond the range of your S-SD in a single turn, you need to either deploy enough units to cover the ENTIRE ocean or establish two picket lines far enough apart that there's no way that an enemy unit can get past your S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Between the S-SD pickets, you should seed in Attack Subs, also spaced out carefully to make sure there are no gaps. That's the only way you're going to spot the enemy subs given the disability of the S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination, the line should look like[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](enemy continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](home continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE][NEWLINE](each [COLOR_RED]+[COLOR_REVERT] and [COLOR_RED]-[COLOR_REVERT] represents an empty ocean square)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The combined 9 spaces between the SD lines means that it's impossible for enemy SD's to slip by, and the double-line of attack subs also ensure that no submarine can make it past without being stuck in at least 1 location where your own Attack Submarine can see it. The absence of an Attack Sub is also a clue that there must be at least 1 enemy sub in the vicinity, so units in the 1st line should be prepared to move up to the next line at any time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The goal is to NOT use the units in the line to make attacks and to place your own battle fleet in a position to attack only after detection of the enemy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack echelon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When attacking an enemy fleet, always check if there's SD's in the stack. If there is, send your own attack-configured Stealth Destroyers in first to engage them. Beyond that, use cruise missiles to soften up the enemy units to around 30 strength, and then send in your highest promoted MC which has Barrage. That MC will probably die, but naval warfare is about attrition - not experience. It'll soften up the fleet for follow up attacks. Then send in additional MC's until there are no units above strength ~20.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, it's time for the assassin SD's to enter the fray and clean up. By holding back promotions, the same group of SD's can be used to attack multiple fleets over time and they're perfectly safe sitting in the middle of the ocean as long as you eliminate enemy SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts and airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Airpower is less powerful now that nearly 1/2 of the modern AI navy can't be detected by recon, but that's why you deployed that Oceanic Surveillance network. Forts give you places to put Stealth Bombers where it can do the most good, and add to the numbers of deployed aircraft. Do NOT send in stealth bombers until the enemy jet fighters are eliminated, but they can be deadly against subs and missile cruisers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each fort should come standard with at least 1 A-SD and 1 S-DD, to provide full coastal surveillance. Then drop in a gunpowder unit with Medic to provide healing and cover against amphib assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carrier airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given the danger of parking a carrier in the middle of the ocean, and how softening up the enemy fleet can be done via cruise missiles - there isn't much of a role for carriers as before. Their job is now more specialized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carriers should also be based in forts/frontier port cities. They can sally out 4 squares, launch air strikes, and then retreat. Rather than trying to avoid the enemy fighters, you're going AFTER them. Strike directly at the enemy carriers, and whittle down their fighters to open them up for stealth bomber strikes. That covers everything between line #1 and #2 on your surveillance net.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can then reload with fighters from a secure home port during the same turn, and be ready to sally forth again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assault role, carriers are a lifesaver. When an enemy city is taken, it's never taken with the airport intact so the amount of airpower available is limited. There's also no option to use nearby cities to provide extra air cover if this is the beachhead. Support the ocean crossing with carriers, and you can park as many fighters in the conquered city as you want. Then every available slot can be used for Stealth Bombers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine shuttle[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unless you plan to use tactical nukes, regular submarines are mainly useful in finding other subs and bringing cruise missiles to bear. Like regular land units in transports, missiles can be transferred from subs to MC's. That will help fleets to keep a full inventory of cruise missles without coming off their forward-deployed stations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the surveillance pickets are keeping an eye open for any intruding units, the submarine carrying missiles to the front should have a secure journey, doubly so if the MC move back enough spaces to shorten the journey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Convoy Escort[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When escorting convoys, you need a BIG fleet unless your sea superiority is so complete that the AI navy is completely decimated. But given production advantages, that's unlikely. In general, a convoy's escorting fleet units should reflect how many turns the fleet will be in transit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MC's = (# turns) x3[NEWLINE]SD's = (# turns) x2[NEWLINE]DD's = (# turns) x1[NEWLINE]Carriers = 3 minimum[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's a lot of ships but you should need 1 escort fleet per ocean and you can use it to escort 4 or 25 transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I consider the "typical" crossing to be 3 turns, landing the army on the 3rd turn. That means a fleet of 9 MC's, 6 SD's, 3 DD's and 3 carriers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of the turn, move the carriers forward 2 spaces and send out 2 fighters to recon for large fleets. That will make sure you detect any large stacks of BB's or MC's for a detour if necessary. Next, send the DD's on a roundabout route to the targeted rendevous point. With S-DD's, you should be able to scan a 6-square wide corridor and still get the DD's to the target point. Any detected subs will be struck by air power. SD's with cruise missiles and subs with air strikes. Move your A-SD's in for the kill and then have them rejoin the fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the final move of the turn, the rest of the fleet (MC, carrier, and transports) will move to the convoy station through a thoroughly sanitized area so that the AI won't know for sure you have transports coming their way. Remember that the AI's LOVE Espionage so they already know your port of embarkation. They just don't know when the transports will sail. But they will know once your transports leave port, so it's important to deny the AI precise location on your transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Final point - the transports should hold off-shore the planned insertion point as far as possible on the final move to keep out of range of land-based air and units which might sally forth from secure ports. That means even if you have the MP's to gt within 4 squares of the coast on that turn, hold off 6-7 squares so that the transport can make a last-turn dash straight for the enemy coast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Coastline defense[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With cruise missiles, stealth destroyers, and air strikes - defending off-shore platforms and fishing boats are just a quick way to get your units killed. Stockpile the work boats and leave those resources unguarded. A good surveillance network will protect your off-shre resources more surely than a bunch of sentry-duty MC's or SD's.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Modern Naval Strategy for Beyond the Sword[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]- by [BOLD]Plato90s[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beyond the Sword changed many things about the game, and naval warfare was one of the most dramatically affected. The limits on aircraft units per city changed the scope, but not the basis of air warfare. The additional units in land warfare made siege units relevant again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But war at sea was completely changed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the vanilla CIV4, naval supremacy was nice to have but not necessary. The worst that could happen from not owning the oceans was losing some fishing boats and an air strike here and there (which you could counter with land-based aircraft). After your massed stealth bombers whittle them down, a few battleships can take down entire fleets of weakened enemy ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cruise missiles and tactical nukes changed all that.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, not having sea superiority means that large stretches of your interior can be devastated, and possibly even nuked. The AI also uses amphibious assaults more often, and in conjunction with missle/nuke strikes. At the same time, the equation for gaining sea power has gotten more complicated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A whole new naval strategy is needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To start, let's cover the main units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Missile Cruiser[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is going to be your main combatant. Once onboard missles are exhausted, this is just a battleship and should be used accordingly. Promotions should be for Drill 1, Drill 2, and then Barrage. The idea is that you want the MC to survive initial combat, and then start prepping the rest of the enemy fleet for destruction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You shouldn't feel the need to always have fully-loaded MC's, but rather keep a few empties around so that they can fight the battles. Once the enemy is down to ~27 strength, a Drill 2 MC should be sent in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a protracted war at sea, expect to build (and lose) a lot of MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Stealth Destroyer[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a misunderstood unit in because it's NOT a replacement for the destroyer the way a MC is a replacement for Battleship in every way. This is a brand new unit, like the Attack Submarine, and needs to be used in a brand new way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two basic role exists for Stealth Destroyers - surveillance and assassin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the surveillance role, the SD should have Flanking and Sentry to maximize the viewing radius. Surveillance SD's (S-SD) should be deployed to make EVERY ocean square between you and your enemy visible. There can be no fog of war when it comes to naval warfare unless you want an entire fleet to sneak up on you. The specifics of how such a picket line should be ployed will be discussed later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another use for the S-SD's is to sneak in and bombard enemy cities' cultural defenses, if your picket lines are close enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assassin role, the SD should have only Drill promotions, and hold those promotions in reserve for healing injuries. Once you kill opposing SD's, your highly damaged SD's can be in the middle of the ocean but also be perfectly safe. That's why your Assassin SD's (A-SD) should be the vehicle of choice for finishing off damaged units or hunting down tranports/subs/carriers. They're the only ones who can survive the aftermath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]SD's should emphatically NOT be employed in a stack with other units, the way the AI does. It doesn't buy you anything, since SD's won't defend against anything except another SD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a critical unit, because the AI really loves to use submarines to deliver tactical nukes. Once you have Stealth Destroyers, you'll need Attack Subs in order to help locate and destroy enemy submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because Attack Subs should only be used against other subs or transports/carriers or heavily damaged units, it's in the same category as a S-SD and should get Flanking and Sentry. Additional promotions should be Navigation 1 and 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is also a crucial unit because it's the way to deliver tactical nukes and additional cruise missles to a front-deployed fleet. There's no combat role for the submarine because it's not powerful enough to fight any of the late-game opponents head on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want missle strikes - better to deliver it from a MC, which can follow up with an attack or survive a counter-attack after getting close to enemy shores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want to detect/kill other subs, the Attack Sub is much better.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why the main role of subs is to either shuttle cruise missles to re-load MC's which have fired their on-board supply or to sneak in a tactical nuke. As such, submarines receive Flanking and Navigation 1/2. Beyond that, add Sentry to help avoid threats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Battleship[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whatever battleships you have as of the time that MC's come along - leave them alone. There's no need to spend money upgrading BB's when they don't gain any combat power and the supply of cruise missiles always tend to trail the number of MC's on hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use the BB's for the same role as they had in CIV4 original - escorting carriers and transports. Their MP's are perfect, once the transport/carrier has been upgraded with Navigation 1. They're just as powerful in defensive role as MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's no particular need to stock up on BB's, and also no reason to change how you use them from the original CIV4. You can't see SD's or subs sneaking up on you, but that's why you have surveillance SD's and Attack Subs anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Destroyers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are critical units which should be stockpiled in large numbers. Build them while you can and NEVER upgrade them. You can always build more SD's, but the supply of destroyers you have are finite[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's have the ability to detect subs, they can move farther than the Attack Subs, and can kill the invading subs just as effectively. On top of that, they still retain their anti-air capabilities, so they're not nearly as vulnerable to air assault as the submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's also come in the same 2 varieties as SD's - surveillance or attack.

The specifics of how such a picket line should be ployed will be discussed later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another use for the S-SD's is to sneak in and bombard enemy cities' cultural defenses, if your picket lines are close enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assassin role, the SD should have only Drill promotions, and hold those promotions in reserve for healing injuries. Once you kill opposing SD's, your highly damaged SD's can be in the middle of the ocean but also be perfectly safe. That's why your Assassin SD's (A-SD) should be the vehicle of choice for finishing off damaged units or hunting down tranports/subs/carriers. They're the only ones who can survive the aftermath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]SD's should emphatically NOT be employed in a stack with other units, the way the AI does. It doesn't buy you anything, since SD's won't defend against anything except another SD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is a critical unit, because the AI really loves to use submarines to deliver tactical nukes. Once you have Stealth Destroyers, you'll need Attack Subs in order to help locate and destroy enemy submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because Attack Subs should only be used against other subs or transports/carriers or heavily damaged units, it's in the same category as a S-SD and should get Flanking and Sentry. Additional promotions should be Navigation 1 and 2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This is also a crucial unit because it's the way to deliver tactical nukes and additional cruise missles to a front-deployed fleet. There's no combat role for the submarine because it's not powerful enough to fight any of the late-game opponents head on.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want missle strikes - better to deliver it from a MC, which can follow up with an attack or survive a counter-attack after getting close to enemy shores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you want to detect/kill other subs, the Attack Sub is much better.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's why the main role of subs is to either shuttle cruise missles to re-load MC's which have fired their on-board supply or to sneak in a tactical nuke. As such, submarines receive Flanking and Navigation 1/2. Beyond that, add Sentry to help avoid threats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Battleship[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Whatever battleships you have as of the time that MC's come along - leave them alone. There's no need to spend money upgrading BB's when they don't gain any combat power and the supply of cruise missiles always tend to trail the number of MC's on hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Instead, use the BB's for the same role as they had in CIV4 original - escorting carriers and transports. Their MP's are perfect, once the transport/carrier has been upgraded with Navigation 1. They're just as powerful in defensive role as MC's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's no particular need to stock up on BB's, and also no reason to change how you use them from the original CIV4. You can't see SD's or subs sneaking up on you, but that's why you have surveillance SD's and Attack Subs anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Destroyers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are critical units which should be stockpiled in large numbers. Build them while you can and NEVER upgrade them. You can always build more SD's, but the supply of destroyers you have are finite[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's have the ability to detect subs, they can move farther than the Attack Subs, and can kill the invading subs just as effectively. On top of that, they still retain their anti-air capabilities, so they're not nearly as vulnerable to air assault as the submarines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]DD's also come in the same 2 varieties as SD's - surveillance or attack. Unlike SD's, surveillance-type DD's should be used to escort large fleets because it'll provide some redundant sub-spotting (and killing) capability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otherwise, attack- and surveillance-DD's should be deployed near shorelines because they're so valuable and so vulnerable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carriers[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In theory, carriers are much less useful than before. Air recon can't detect submarines or Stealth Destroyers, and the naval strike role which made Jet fighters valuable can now be taken over by missiles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, carriers are still useful for providing first-strike on detected submarines and MC's which have been stripped of their escorts. More importantly, they have a HUGE role in one of the main purposes of the navy - supporting a beachhead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Technically not an unit, but so crucial it deserves its own mention. With BTS, fortifications act as cities for naval and air purposes. That means new tricks which were impossible before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A naval unit can use a fort to create a land-bridge to cross an island while an enemy fleet must take the long way around. A ship can move from ocean-to-fort #1, then fort #1-to-city, then city-to-fort #2, and finally fort #2 to ocean. A crossing which might have used on the entire MP quota of a MC could instead be completed with only 4 MP's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ocean-Fort-City-Fort-Ocean[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can also be constructed to give you secure naval bases in stretches of your territory where it makes no sense to plant a city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A fort can be used to house fighters/bombers to help support your coastal defense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now, if you're lucky enough to have an island off your shore, build a city on it just to be able to use it as forward air/naval station. Forts give you shortcuts to help chase down a faster enemy, and a secure way of bringing your transports further along before exposing them to attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Naval deployments[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several major categories of naval war strategy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can choose to fight a defensive action, where your fleets are deployed out of home ports and are tasked with killing any unit you see. The goal is to protect your own lands while the land war continues or you're trying to prevent a landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There's also the offensive approach, where you bring your fleets near the enemy cities to offer battle and to strike at their infrastructure. The goal is to decimate their coastal cities and wipe out their fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, there's the sea-lane action where the goal is to maintain a secure travel route in order to ship in more units for the war in a distant location.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In reality, a large war will always involve at least some of each of the 3 in different phases. It might start with a defensive action, then you'd move to secure a sea lane to provide an invasion corridor, and finally shift over to a total offensive action.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Or it might be the other way around, where you deploy your fleet to a forward position to nail the initial stack-of-doom invasion fleet and then pull back to a defensive position shortly afterwards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In all cases, there are some basic tactics to consider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Oceanic Surveillance[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the Stealth Destroyer, it's critical that you cover the ocean with your own Surveillance-SD's. Each S-SD can cover 14 ocean squares, so it doesn't take that many units. Because enemy SD's can easily move beyond the range of your S-SD in a single turn, you need to either deploy enough units to cover the ENTIRE ocean or establish two picket lines far enough apart that there's no way that an enemy unit can get past your S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Between the S-SD pickets, you should seed in Attack Subs, also spaced out carefully to make sure there are no gaps. That's the only way you're going to spot the enemy subs given the disability of the S-SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In combination, the line should look like[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](enemy continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 2)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE]--SD----SD----SD----SD----SD-- [BOLD](SD line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]AS----AS----AS----AS----AS-- [BOLD](AS line 1)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]+[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S [BOLD](home continent)[\BOLD] N[NEWLINE][NEWLINE](each [COLOR_RED]+[COLOR_REVERT] and [COLOR_RED]-[COLOR_REVERT] represents an empty ocean square)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The combined 9 spaces between the SD lines means that it's impossible for enemy SD's to slip by, and the double-line of attack subs also ensure that no submarine can make it past without being stuck in at least 1 location where your own Attack Submarine can see it. The absence of an Attack Sub is also a clue that there must be at least 1 enemy sub in the vicinity, so units in the 1st line should be prepared to move up to the next line at any time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The goal is to NOT use the units in the line to make attacks and to place your own battle fleet in a position to attack only after detection of the enemy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Attack echelon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When attacking an enemy fleet, always check if there's SD's in the stack. If there is, send your own attack-configured Stealth Destroyers in first to engage them. Beyond that, use cruise missiles to soften up the enemy units to around 30 strength, and then send in your highest promoted MC which has Barrage. That MC will probably die, but naval warfare is about attrition - not experience. It'll soften up the fleet for follow up attacks. Then send in additional MC's until there are no units above strength ~20.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, it's time for the assassin SD's to enter the fray and clean up. By holding back promotions, the same group of SD's can be used to attack multiple fleets over time and they're perfectly safe sitting in the middle of the ocean as long as you eliminate enemy SD's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Forts and airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Airpower is less powerful now that nearly 1/2 of the modern AI navy can't be detected by recon, but that's why you deployed that Oceanic Surveillance network. Forts give you places to put Stealth Bombers where it can do the most good, and add to the numbers of deployed aircraft. Do NOT send in stealth bombers until the enemy jet fighters are eliminated, but they can be deadly against subs and missile cruisers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each fort should come standard with at least 1 A-SD and 1 S-DD, to provide full coastal surveillance. Then drop in a gunpowder unit with Medic to provide healing and cover against amphib assault.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carrier airpower[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given the danger of parking a carrier in the middle of the ocean, and how softening up the enemy fleet can be done via cruise missiles - there isn't much of a role for carriers as before. Their job is now more specialized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carriers should also be based in forts/frontier port cities. They can sally out 4 squares, launch air strikes, and then retreat. Rather than trying to avoid the enemy fighters, you're going AFTER them. Strike directly at the enemy carriers, and whittle down their fighters to open them up for stealth bomber strikes. That covers everything between line #1 and #2 on your surveillance net.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can then reload with fighters from a secure home port during the same turn, and be ready to sally forth again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the assault role, carriers are a lifesaver. When an enemy city is taken, it's never taken with the airport intact so the amount of airpower available is limited. There's also no option to use nearby cities to provide extra air cover if this is the beachhead. Support the ocean crossing with carriers, and you can park as many fighters in the conquered city as you want. Then every available slot can be used for Stealth Bombers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Submarine shuttle[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unless you plan to use tactical nukes, regular submarines are mainly useful in finding other subs and bringing cruise missiles to bear. Like regular land units in transports, missiles can be transferred from subs to MC's. That will help fleets to keep a full inventory of cruise missles without coming off their forward-deployed stations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the surveillance pickets are keeping an eye open for any intruding units, the submarine carrying missiles to the front should have a secure journey, doubly so if the MC move back enough spaces to shorten the journey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Convoy Escort[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When escorting convoys, you need a BIG fleet unless your sea superiority is so complete that the AI navy is completely decimated. But given production advantages, that's unlikely. In general, a convoy's escorting fleet units should reflect how many turns the fleet will be in transit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MC's = (# turns) x3[NEWLINE]SD's = (# turns) x2[NEWLINE]DD's = (# turns) x1[NEWLINE]Carriers = 3 minimum[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That's a lot of ships but you should need 1 escort fleet per ocean and you can use it to escort 4 or 25 transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I consider the "typical" crossing to be 3 turns, landing the army on the 3rd turn. That means a fleet of 9 MC's, 6 SD's, 3 DD's and 3 carriers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of the turn, move the carriers forward 2 spaces and send out 2 fighters to recon for large fleets. That will make sure you detect any large stacks of BB's or MC's for a detour if necessary. Next, send the DD's on a roundabout route to the targeted rendevous point. With S-DD's, you should be able to scan a 6-square wide corridor and still get the DD's to the target point. Any detected subs will be struck by air power. SD's with cruise missiles and subs with air strikes. Move your A-SD's in for the kill and then have them rejoin the fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the final move of the turn, the rest of the fleet (MC, carrier, and transports) will move to the convoy station through a thoroughly sanitized area so that the AI won't know for sure you have transports coming their way. Remember that the AI's LOVE Espionage so they already know your port of embarkation. They just don't know when the transports will sail. But they will know once your transports leave port, so it's important to deny the AI precise location on your transports.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Final point - the transports should hold off-shore the planned insertion point as far as possible on the final move to keep out of range of land-based air and units which might sally forth from secure ports. That means even if you have the MP's to gt within 4 squares of the coast on that turn, hold off 6-7 squares so that the transport can make a last-turn dash straight for the enemy coast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Coastline defense[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With cruise missiles, stealth destroyers, and air strikes - defending off-shore platforms and fishing boats are just a quick way to get your units killed. Stockpile the work boats and leave those resources unguarded. A good surveillance network will protect your off-shre resources more surely than a bunch of sentry-duty MC's or SD's.</Spanish>
